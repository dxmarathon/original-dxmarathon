new DX Marathon Manager - Mark, WC3W</font></b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: black">Hello CQ DX Marathon 
participants.&nbsp; I am WC3W, Mark and I have been working with John, K9EL almost 
six months now in understanding various aspects of the DX Marathon program.&nbsp; 
Wow, it is truly amazing that one man actually managed this pretty much by 
himself.&nbsp; It is an amazing program but takes a huge amount of work.&nbsp; </span>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: black">The presumption under which I am 
assuming the administration role was that I recruit a number of key individuals 
to dispatch the many tasks associated with the program.&nbsp; I have done this and 
our key volunteer managers are:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Program Administrator and CEO- WC3W Mark Wohlschlegel<br>
Scoring Manager- WO7R- Larry Loen<br>
IT Manager- KI2D- Sebastian Delmont<br>
Awards Manager- K0XM- Chuck Kraly<br>
Rules &amp; Compliance Manager- W4OX- Doug McDuff<br>
Communications Manager- K2CIB- John Samuels<br>
<br>
You can reach any of these Managers by posting right on the io group page for 
the DXMarathon.&nbsp; We all monitor this site and will respond quickly to any 
questions that you might have. I also encourage you to frequently visit the

web page.&nbsp; It has a ton of information on it.&nbsp; Furthermore, Sebastian has 
redesigned this website and we will be launching a new improved site mid-January 
2023.<br>

<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: black">I hope all of you are getting 
ready to submit your 2022 score sheets. Remember, these must be received by 
January 5 2023.&nbsp; No exceptions.&nbsp; Although the website does not have yet the 2023 
rules, they are identical to the 2022 rules.&nbsp; Please check and double check your 
submittals to make sure calls are correct, zones are correct, etc.</span></font></p>

I look forward to growing and making the DX Marathon program lots of fun.&nbsp; Many 
like myself do it not because you want plaques or certificates, but as a metric 
for how your operating skills and improvements in your station have worked.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: black">We consciously did not want to 
make any changes to the program during CY2023 as we see this as a transition 
year for the new team.&nbsp; However, during the course of the year, we WILL be 
making some very interesting changes adding categories, etc to the 2024 rules.&nbsp; 
Although we have generous sponsors, our ability to make changes will require 
some financial resources.&nbsp; Although the DX Marathon does not charge for 
participation, I would encourage you to make a small contribution through the 
Paypal icon on our webpage.&nbsp; As we move into the year, as we collect 
contributions, we will more greatly expand the program…so your contributions 
will fuel this growth.<br>

Good luck---and don't be bashful---post questions and look on the website as we 
have added an&nbsp;</span><a target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="https://www.dxmarathon.com/FAQ/FAQ.htm"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt">FAQ</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: black">.<br>
