<font size="5" face="Arial">CQ Magazine's Annual DX Marathon</font><p style="text-align: left">
<b><font size="2" face="Arial">Starting January 1 of each year, the DX Marathon is the 
perfect answer for the DX-er who needs that extra incentive to get on the air 
every day! Simply work as many countries and CQ Zones as you can in each 
calendar year, regardless of the band or mode.&nbsp; Each country and zone 
counts only once, so you can concentrate on working new ones rather than working 
the same ones on multiple bands and modes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many awards are given for the 
top overall scores in four classes plus top scores in modes, bands, US call 
areas and more!&nbsp;&nbsp; Details of the extensive award list are 
available <a target="_blank" href="Z-Old%20Index%20Files/Awards/Awards.htm">here</a><a href="mailto:info@dxmarathon.com">.</a></font></b></p>

<p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial" size="4">CQ DX Marathon – help 
plan for the future!</font></p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial" size="4"><br>
In 2005, W9KNI and CQ Magazine asked me if I was interested in managing a new 
contest for CQ Magazine – the CQ DX Marathon. This new contest/DX program 
sounded very interesting, and I thought it would be a great program to keep old 
timers interested in working DX. As it was a new contest, there was nothing 
available in terms of tools, scoring software, web site, etc. Over the years the 
DX Marathon has grown significantly and has become an annual event with a 
tremendous following.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial" size="4"><br>
But the DX Marathon would never have reached its current level of activity 
without the dedicated help from many people. Alex, VE3NEA, was one of the first 
to jump in with his idea of software to score the contest. It is still in use 
today. Jim, AD1C, has created many DX Marathon tools and a dedicated DX Marathon 
web page. Dave, AA6YQ, was the first logging program author to build DX Marathon 
support directly into his excellent software. Mike, W9MR, has built our online 
submission tools. John, W9ILY, prepares the 100+ certificates every year. VK3AMA 
has fully supported the DX Marathon in his JT Alert software. W9KNI and PY5EG 
not only provide significant financial support but have also provided many great 
ideas and emotional support. Bernie, W3UR, has been very supportive of the 
Marathon in his Daily and Weekly DX Bulletins. Our many plaque sponsors have 
provided incentives for participants to strive for the top positions.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial" size="4"><br>
However, the Marathon is now at a turning point. Participation has grown 
significantly the last two years and many of the processes are still done 
manually. I am not a software person by education or trade, so I am not able to 
automate more of the work without asking for additional external support. In 
addition, the introduction of FT8 has changed the face of the Marathon. On the 
positive side, the weak signal capabilities of FT8 have allowed low power and 
compromised antenna participants to submit some amazing scores. On the downside, 
79% of all submitted QSOs are now FT8 and combined with the Internet, cheating 
among a few participants has increased. In summary, the DX Marathon needs a 
fresh look, some updated tools, and some serious work on evaluating submitted 
logs.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial" size="4"><br>
After 17 years and watching my advancing age, I told CQ Magazine late last year 
that 2022 would be my last year to manage the DX Marathon. To date, they have 
not been able to find a replacement for me to manage the Marathon. Each of you 
on this letter has had a significant impact on the Marathon, so I am turning to 
all of you with the request to find a person, persons, or organization to assume 
leadership of the DX Marathon. I have approached the WWROF, but there has been 
little interest in the DX Marathon. Perhaps I did not handle the requests 
properly.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial" size="4"><br>
If you or any of your contacts has an interest in managing the DX Marathon, 
please contact me directly. Finding a replacement person or organization now 
would provide a lot of overlap time as there is plenty to learn.</font></p>
<p style="text-align: left; line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial" size="4"><br>
Thank you for your support of the DX Marathon and reading this note. I will 
surely miss many aspects of managing the program, but it is time for me to step 
down.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
John K9EL<br>
