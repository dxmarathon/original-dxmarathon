<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">The 2013 edition of the CQ 
DX Marathon begins at 0000 UTC on January 1, 2013 and runs through 2359 UTC on 
December 31, 2013.&nbsp; The goal, as always, is to work as many countries and CQ 
zones as possible at least once during the calendar year. &nbsp;&nbsp;There are no 
significant changes to the rules this year, but some clarifications have been 
added for Formula Class antennas in the Appendix.&nbsp; We will continue to use a 
downloadable Microsoft Excel® sheet which can be used throughout the year to 
track your progress and then emailed at the end as your submission – no extra 
forms required! Many programs are now available to automatically populate the 
sheet from your logging program.&nbsp; See the DX Marathon website for details.&nbsp; Here 
are the 2013 rules for the CQ DX Marathon:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span><b><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Activity period: </span></b><span style="font-family: Arial">The CQ DX Marathon 
is a year-long activity, beginning at 0000 UTC January 1 and ending at 2359 UTC 
December 31.&nbsp; Each year’s event is separate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Frequencies:</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> Any authorized amateur 
frequency may be used.&nbsp; Contacts through repeaters or satellites are not allowed 
for credit, nor are contacts with maritime or aeronautical mobile stations.&nbsp; All 
contacts must be made entirely over amateur radio frequencies – i.e., Echolink-type 
contacts do not count.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Modes:</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> Any authorized amateur mode 
may be used, but three modes will be recognized in the DX Marathon – CW, PHONE 
and Digital.&nbsp; All modes other than CW or voice modes will count as Digital.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Categories:</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> Each entrant in the DX 
Marathon may submit one log each year per operating location.&nbsp; Participants 
submitting logs for single mode or single band entries must include only those 
contacts.&nbsp; Logs submitted with multiple mode or multiple bands will not be 
considered for mode and band awards.&nbsp; Entries with two or more callsigns will 
only count as a single entry if all contacts were made by the same (single) 
operator at the same station using the same antennas. Entries that include 
contacts made with the assistance of remote receivers and/or transmitters in 
addition to contacts from a primary station are not permitted. There are two 
entry classes, “Formula” and “Unlimited.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.0pt"><i>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Formula:</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
An entrant may choose one of two options in this class: (1) All contacts must be 
made with a maximum output power of 10 watts, regardless of band or mode; or (2) 
the operator may run a maximum of 100 watts output to a simple antenna, such as 
a vertical or dipole (see the appendix below for further rules on antennas used 
in either option for Formula class). An operator in Formula class must select 
QRP (10 watts or less) or 100 watts and limited antennas at the beginning of the 
year’s DX Marathon, and may not switch between entry modes during the year.&nbsp; All 
contacts must be made without assistance of any sort, including but not limited 
to lists, passes, or use of higher power or prohibited antennas to initially 
secure the contact.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of spotting nets such as a DX Cluster® is allowed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.0pt"><i>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Unlimited:</span></i><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
Any antenna may be used, along with any power level for which the operator is 
licensed.&nbsp; Use of spotting nets such as DX Cluster® is allowed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.0pt"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Scoring: </span></b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Each country worked is worth one point.&nbsp; Each 
CQ zone worked is worth one point.&nbsp; The total score is the sum of zones and 
countries worked, on any mode and any authorized band.&nbsp; There are no multipliers 
of any kind.&nbsp; Each country and zone count only once.&nbsp; A single QSO may count for 
both a country and a zone.&nbsp; If in the course of the year you work 238 countries 
and 37 zones, your score is 275.&nbsp; If you work all 40 zones and 150 countries, 
your score is 190. The CQ DX Countries List and the CQ Zone List constitute the 
official lists.&nbsp; The lists are available on the DX Marathon web site.&nbsp; In the 
case of ties, the operator whose last scoring contact was earlier 
chronologically will be judged the winner.&nbsp; Decisions of the Marathon Manager 
are final.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Submissions:</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
Submissions must be made electronically, via email to
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="mailto:scores@dxmarathon.com">
scores@dxmarathon.com</a>.&nbsp; A Microsoft Excel® template into which contacts may 
be entered is available for download from the CQ DX Marathon website at
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.dxmarathon.com/">
http://www.dxmarathon.com</a>.&nbsp; The website also provides other options for 
those without access to Excel®.&nbsp; All scores must be received by January 10 
following the close of each DX Marathon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Verification:</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
QSLs are not required.&nbsp; The operator is expected to claim contacts only from 
stations the operator has every reason to believe are legitimate, and only to 
claim contacts in which an accurate two-way exchange was clearly accomplished 
(see Appendix for further explanation).&nbsp; Scores will be adjusted by the DX 
Marathon committee for claimed contacts with pirates or any station not 
considered legitimate.&nbsp; Submissions may be penalized or voided in cases of fraud 
or poor sportsmanship.&nbsp; Submissions that do not provide detailed descriptions of 
Formula class antennas (type, height and length, for example) to clearly 
demonstrate that the antennas meet the rules and the intent of Formula Class may 
be re-classified to Unlimited class.&nbsp; Decisions of the Marathon Manager are 
final.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Clubs: </span></b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Clubs are strongly encouraged to use the 
framework of this contest for intramural and regional competitions.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: Arial">Results: </span></b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">The final listing of official scores and 
winners will be published in CQ Magazine.&nbsp; The scores will also be posted on the 
DX Marathon website approximately one month after the results are published in 
CQ Magazine. </span></p>

SSB, Continent and Band winners are awarded regardless of Class and will only be 
awarded if the winning scores in those categories are at least 50% of the score 
of the overall DX Marathon Unlimited Class winner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Entrants may receive only 
one plaque per year.&nbsp; In the case of a participant qualifying for more than one 
plaque, that participant will receive a plaque for the highest level based on 
the above order. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in"><i>

Certificates are awarded to qualified participants in this order: &nbsp;Highest 
overall score in each CQ Zone; Highest overall score in each Country; Highest 
overall score in the Formula Class 10 watts or less option.&nbsp; Plaque winners are 
not eligible for certificates.&nbsp; Only one certificate will be awarded per 
entrant.&nbsp; In the case of a participant qualifying for more than one certificate, 
that participant will receive a certificate for the highest level based on the 
above order.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in">
<span style="font-family: Arial">In all cases, the rulings of the CQ DX Marathon 
Manager are final.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><b><i><span style="font-family: Arial">APPENDIX</span></i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Formula Class antennas, option 1: </span></b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Operators selecting the 10 watt option are 
limited to antennas on a single tower and whose height does not exceed 65 feet 
or 20 meters above ground elevation within 330 feet or 100 meters of the tower 
base.&nbsp; Wire antennas may also be used but must meet the criteria of the 100 watt 
option, and may be tower-supported at only one point.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Formula Class antennas, option 2:</span></b><span style="font-family: Arial"> 
Antennas for operators choosing the 100 watt option must be either simple 
verticals or wire antennas lacking significant gain.&nbsp; No arrays are allowed, 
whether vertical or horizontal.&nbsp; Wire antennas, regardless of type, may not 
exceed 130 feet or 40 meters in length, may not be higher than 65 feet or 20 
meters above ground at any point of the antenna and may be tower supported at 
only one point.&nbsp; The tallest point of vertical antennas used may not be higher 
that 65 feet or 20 meters above ground. &nbsp;Yagis, quads and rotatable dipoles may 
not be used in this category.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no limit on the number of antennas that 
can be used as long as each antenna meets the above criteria.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Contacts: </span></b>
<span style="font-family: Arial">Each contact for a claimed country or zone must 
be a solid contact.&nbsp;&nbsp; The station claiming a contact with another station is 
expected to have had his or her callsign fully and accurately received and 
transmitted by the other station, and to have copied his/her own call being 
correctly sent by the other station.&nbsp; For example, K2MGA may not claim credit 
for a QSO with a DX station who had his call as K3MGA, even though in many cases 
the DX station would QSL the contact with the correction made (after receiving a 
card from K2MGA, realizing the error and correcting his/her log). For a contact 
to count, both stations must correctly copy all of both callsigns.</span></p>
