<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The 2012 edition of the CQ DX Marathon begins at 0000 UTC 
on January 1, 2012 and runs through 2359 UTC on December 31, 2012.&nbsp; The goal, as 
always, is to work as many countries and CQ zones as possible at least once 
during the calendar year. &nbsp;&nbsp;There are no significant changes to the rules this 
year, but there will be a significant increase in the number of plaques 
awarded.&nbsp; Sincere thanks to our new sponsors!&nbsp; We will continue to use a 
downloadable Microsoft Excel® template (or equivalent) which may be filled in 
and emailed to a special address as your log entry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversion programs are 
available to automatically populate the template from your logging program.&nbsp; See 
the 2012 Submission page on this website for details.&nbsp; Here are the 2012 rules for the CQ DX 
Marathon:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:
Arial">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Activity period: </span></b>
<span style="font-family:
Arial">The CQ DX Marathon is a year-long activity, beginning at 0000 UTC January 
1 and ending at 2359 UTC December 31.&nbsp; Each year’s event is separate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-family:
Arial">Frequencies:</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"> 
Any authorized amateur frequency may be used.&nbsp; Contacts through repeaters or 
satellites are not allowed for credit, nor are contacts with maritime or 
aeronautical mobile stations.&nbsp; All contacts must be made entirely over amateur 
radio frequencies – i.e., Echolink-type contacts do not count.&nbsp; Submissions with 
all contacts utilizing a single band will be recognized.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-family:
Arial">Modes:</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"> Any 
authorized amateur mode may be used.&nbsp; Three modes will be recognized in the DX 
Marathon – CW, SSB and Digital.&nbsp; All modes other than CW or voice modes will 
count as Digital. Submissions with all contacts utilizing a single mode will be 
recognized.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-family:
Arial">Categories:</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"> 
Each entrant in the DX Marathon may submit one log each year per operating 
location.&nbsp; Participants submitting logs for single mode or single band entries 
must include only those contacts.&nbsp; Logs submitted with multiple mode or multiple 
bands will not be considered for mode and band awards.&nbsp; Entries with two or more 
callsigns will only count as a single entry if all contacts were made by the 
same (single) operator at the same station using the same antennas. Entries that 
include contacts made with the assistance of remote receivers and/or 
transmitters in addition to contacts from a primary station are not permitted. 
There are two entry classes, “Formula” and “Unlimited.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.0pt"><i>
<span style="font-family:Arial">Formula:</span></i><span style="font-family:Arial"> 
An entrant may choose one of two options in this class: (1) All contacts must be 
made with a maximum output power of 10 watts, regardless of band or mode; or (2) 
the operator may run a maximum of 100 watts output to a simple antenna, such as 
a vertical or dipole (see the appendix below for further rules on antennas used 
in either option for Formula class). An operator in Formula class must select 
QRP (10 watts or less) or 100 watts and limited antennas at the beginning of the 
year’s DX Marathon, and may not switch between entry modes during the year.&nbsp; All 
contacts must be made without assistance of any sort, including but not limited 
to lists, passes, or use of higher power or prohibited antennas to initially 
secure the contact.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of spotting nets such as a DX Cluster® is allowed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.0pt"><i>
<span style="font-family:Arial">Unlimited:</span></i><span style="font-family:Arial"> 
Any antenna may be used, along with any power level for which the operator is 
licensed.&nbsp; Use of spotting nets such as DX Cluster® is allowed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-family:
Arial">Scoring: </span></b><span style="font-family:Arial">Each 
country worked is worth one point.&nbsp; Each CQ zone worked is worth one point.&nbsp; The 
total score is the sum of zones and countries worked, on any mode and any 
authorized band.&nbsp; There are no multipliers of any kind.&nbsp; Each country and zone 
count only once.&nbsp; A single QSO may count for both a country and a zone.&nbsp; If in 
the course of the year you work 238 countries and 37 zones, your score is 275.&nbsp; 
If you work all 40 zones and 150 countries, your score is 190. The CQ DX 
Countries List and the CQ Zone List constitute the official lists.&nbsp; The lists 
are available on the DX Marathon web site.&nbsp; In the case of ties, the operator 
whose last scoring contact was earlier chronologically will be judged the 
winner.&nbsp; Decisions of the Marathon Manager are final.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-family:
Arial">Submissions:</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"> 
Submissions must be made electronically, via email to
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="mailto:scores@dxmarathon.com">
scores@dxmarathon.com</a>.&nbsp; A Microsoft Excel® template into which contacts may 
be entered is available for download from the CQ DX Marathon website at
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.dxmarathon.com/">
http://www.dxmarathon.com</a>.&nbsp; The website also provides other options for 
those without access to Excel®.&nbsp; All scores must be received by January 15 
following the close of each DX Marathon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-family:
Arial">Verification:</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"> 
QSLs are not required.&nbsp; The operator is expected to claim contacts only from 
stations the operator has every reason to believe are legitimate, and only to 
claim contacts in which an accurate two-way exchange was clearly accomplished 
(see Appendix for further explanation).&nbsp; Scores will be adjusted by the DX 
Marathon committee for claimed contacts with pirates or any station not 
considered legitimate.&nbsp; Submissions may be penalized or voided in cases of fraud 
or poor sportsmanship.&nbsp; Submissions that do not provide clear descriptions of 
Formula class antennas to show that the antennas meet the Formula class antenna 
rules may be re-classified to Unlimited class.&nbsp; Decisions of the Marathon 
Manager are final.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-family:

are strongly encouraged to use the framework of this contest for intramural and 
regional competitions.</span></p>

those categories are at least 50% of the score of the overall DX Marathon 
Unlimited Class winner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Entrants may receive only one plaque per year.&nbsp; In the 
case of a participant qualifying for more than one plaque, that participant will 
receive a plaque for the highest level based on the above order. Plaques may be 
awarded to runners-up at the discretion of the DX Marathon Committee.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in"><i>

In the case of a participant qualifying for more than one certificate, that 
participant will receive a certificate for the highest level based on the above 
order.&nbsp; Certificates may be awarded to runners-up at the discretion of the DX 
Marathon Committee.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in">
<span style="font-family:Arial">In all cases, the rulings of 
the CQ DX Marathon Committee and the CQ DX Marathon Manager are final.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><span style="font-family:Arial">
APPENDIX</span></i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-family:Arial">Formula Class antennas, option 
1: </span></b><span style="font-family:Arial">Operators 
selecting the 10 watt option are limited to antennas on a single tower and whose 
height does not exceed 65 feet or 20 meters above ground elevation within 330 
feet or 100 meters of the tower base.&nbsp; Wire antennas may also be used but must 
meet the criteria of the 100 watt option, and may be tower-supported at only one 
point.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-family:Arial">Formula Class antennas, option 
2:</span></b><span style="font-family:Arial"> Antennas for 
operators choosing the 100 watt option must be either simple verticals or wire 
antennas lacking significant gain.&nbsp; No arrays are allowed, whether vertical or 
horizontal, nor are long wires exceeding 130 feet or 40 meters, except on 80 and 
160 meters.&nbsp; The base of vertical antennas used may not exceed 65 feet or 20 
meters in height. Dipoles or other wire antennas must not be more than 60 feet 
above ground. Yagis, quads, or tower mounted antennas (except wire antennas 
meeting the height limits above) may not be used in this category.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-family:Arial">Contacts: </span></b>
<span style="font-family:Arial">Each contact for a claimed 
country or zone must be a solid contact.&nbsp;&nbsp; The station claiming a contact with 
another station is expected to have had his or her callsign fully and accurately 
received and transmitted by the other station, and to have copied his/her own 
call being correctly sent by the other station.&nbsp; For example, K2MGA may not 
claim credit for a QSO with a DX station who had his call as K3MGA, even though 
in many cases the DX station would QSL the contact with the correction made 
(after receiving a card from K2MGA, realizing the error and correcting his/her 
log). For a contact to count, both stations must correctly copy all of both 
callsigns.</span></p>
