Rule Changes for the 2014 CQ DX Marathon:</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We have introduced a third 
class of competition - Limited Class.&nbsp; The new Limited Class will allow those 
running 100 watts and small directional antennas to participate in their own 
class.&nbsp; A plaque will be awarded to the 2014 Limited Class winner.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">We have also removed the 
restrictions on using nets and lists for all classes.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">In the Formula low power 
category, the maximum power output level is now 5 watts.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial">Activity period: </span></b>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial">The CQ DX Marathon is a year-long activity, beginning at 0000 UTC January 
1 and ending at 2359 UTC December 31.&nbsp; Each year’s event is separate.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial">Frequencies:</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> 
Any authorized amateur frequency may be used.&nbsp; Contacts through repeaters or 
satellites are not allowed for credit, nor are contacts with maritime or 
aeronautical mobile stations.&nbsp; All contacts must be made entirely over amateur 
radio frequencies – i.e., Echolink-type contacts do not count.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial">Modes:</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> Any 
authorized amateur mode may be used, but three modes will be recognized in the 
DX Marathon – CW, PHONE and Digital.&nbsp; All modes other than CW or voice modes 
will count as Digital. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial">Categories:</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> 
Each entrant in the DX Marathon may submit one log each year per operating 
location.&nbsp; Participants submitting logs for single mode or single band entries 
must include only those contacts.&nbsp; Logs submitted with multiple mode or multiple 
bands will not be considered for mode and band awards.&nbsp; Entries with two or more 
callsigns will only count as a single entry if all contacts were made by the 
same (single) operator at the same station using the same antennas. Remote 
operation is permitted if all transmitters, receivers, and antennas are at one 
physical location.</span><span style="font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Arial">&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">A remote station in a 
different country than the entrant's country of license must comply with all 
local laws and regulations. Entries that include contacts made with the 
assistance of remote receivers and/or transmitters in addition to contacts from 
a primary station are not permitted. There are three entry classes, “Formula,” 
“Limited” and “Unlimited.”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.0pt"><i>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Formula:</span></i><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> 
An entrant may choose one of two options in this class: (1) All contacts must be 
made with a maximum output power of 5 watts, regardless of band or mode; or (2) 
the operator may run a maximum of 100 watts output to a simple antenna, such as 
a vertical or dipole (see the appendix below for further rules on antennas used 
in either option for Formula class). An operator in Formula class must select 
QRP (5 watts or less) or 100 watts and limited antennas at the beginning of the 
year’s DX Marathon, and may not switch between entry modes during the year.&nbsp; All 
contacts must be made without the use of higher power or prohibited antennas to 
initially secure the contact.&nbsp; &nbsp;Use of spotting nets such as a DX Cluster® is 
allowed.&nbsp; Details of antennas used in Formula Class must be included on the 
official submission form in order to qualify for Formula Class.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.0pt"><i>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Limited: </span></i>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Limited Class entrants are 
allowed a maximum output power of 100 watts and simple antennas, such as 
verticals or dipoles, plus small directional antennas such as Yagis and 
multi-element loop, hex and quad type antennas for the 6, 10, 12, 15, 17 and 20 
meter bands, and single-element rotatable dipoles for the 30 and 40 meter 
bands.&nbsp; See the Appendix below for further description of Limited Class 
antennas. All contacts must be made without the use of higher power or 
prohibited antennas to initially secure the contact.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of spotting nets such 
as a DX Cluster® is allowed.&nbsp; Details of antennas used in Limited Class must be 
included on the official submission form in order to qualify for Limited Class.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:21.0pt"><i>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Unlimited:</span></i><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> 
Any antenna may be used, along with any power level for which the operator is 
licensed.&nbsp; Use of spotting nets such as DX Cluster® is allowed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial">Scoring: </span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Each 
country worked is worth one point.&nbsp; Each CQ zone worked is worth one point.&nbsp; The 
total score is the sum of zones and countries worked, on any mode and any 
authorized band.&nbsp; There are no multipliers of any kind.&nbsp; Each country and zone 
count only once.&nbsp; A single QSO may count for both a country and a zone.&nbsp; If in 
the course of the year you work 238 countries and 37 zones, your score is 275.&nbsp; 
If you work all 40 zones and 150 countries, your score is 190. The CQ DX 
Countries List and the CQ Zone List constitute the official lists.&nbsp; The lists 
are available on the DX Marathon web site.&nbsp; In the case of ties, the operator 
whose last scoring contact was earlier chronologically will be judged the 
winner.&nbsp; Decisions of the Marathon Manager are final.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial">Submissions:</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> 
Submissions must be made electronically, via email to
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="mailto:scores@dxmarathon.com">
scores@dxmarathon.com</a>.&nbsp; A Microsoft Excel® template into which contacts may 
be entered is available for download from the CQ DX Marathon website at
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.dxmarathon.com/">
http://www.dxmarathon.com</a>.&nbsp; The website also provides other options for 
those without access to Excel®.&nbsp; All scores must be received by January 10 
following the close of each DX Marathon.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:3.0pt;text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:
Arial">Verification:</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> 
QSLs are not required.&nbsp; The operator is expected to claim contacts only from 
stations the operator has every reason to believe are legitimate, and only to 
claim contacts in which an accurate two-way exchange was clearly accomplished 
(see Appendix for further explanation).&nbsp; Scores will be adjusted by the DX 
Marathon committee for claimed contacts with pirates or any station not 
considered legitimate.&nbsp; Submissions may be penalized or voided in cases of fraud 
or poor sportsmanship.&nbsp; Submissions that do not provide detailed descriptions of 
Formula class antennas (type, height and length, for example) to clearly 
demonstrate that the antennas meet the rules and the intent of Formula Class may 
be re-classified to Unlimited class.&nbsp; Decisions of the Marathon Manager are 
final.</span></p>

are awarded regardless of Class and will only be awarded if the winning scores 
in those categories are at least 50% of the score of the overall DX Marathon 
Unlimited Class winner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Entrants may receive only one plaque per year.&nbsp; In the 
case of a participant qualifying for more than one plaque, that participant will 
receive a plaque for the highest level based on the above order. </span></p>

<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Formula Class antennas, option 
1: </span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Operators 
selecting the 5 watt option are limited to antennas on a single tower and whose 
height does not exceed 65 feet or 20 meters above ground elevation.&nbsp; Wire 
antennas may also be used but must meet the criteria of the 100 watt option, and 
may be tower-supported at only one point.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Formula Class antennas, option 
2:</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial"> Antennas for 
operators choosing the 100 watt option must be either simple verticals or wire 
antennas lacking significant gain.&nbsp; No arrays are allowed, whether vertical or 
horizontal.&nbsp; Wire antennas, regardless of type, may not exceed 130 feet or 40 
meters in length, may not be higher than 65 feet or 20 meters above ground at 
any point of the antenna and may be tower supported at only one point.&nbsp; The 
tallest point of vertical antennas used may not be higher than 65 feet or 20 
meters above ground. &nbsp;Yagis, quads and rotatable dipoles may not be used in this 
category.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no limit on the number of antennas that may be used as long 
as each antenna meets the above criteria.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Limited Class Antennas: </span>
</b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Antennas for Limited Class 
include all Formula Class option 2 antennas for use on all bands plus 
directional antennas such as Yagis and multi-element loop, hex and quad type 
antennas. Directional antennas with no more than 3 elements used per band are 
allowed on the 20-meter through 6-meter bands.&nbsp; Boom length may not exceed 16 
feet (5 meters) for antennas with booms. Single element rotatable dipoles are 
allowed for the 30 and 40 meter bands. &nbsp;Directional antennas and rotatable 
dipoles must not be higher than 50 feet (15 meters) above ground and all 
antennas must be on a single tower or support. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in"><b>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Contacts: </span></b>
<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Each contact for a claimed 
country or zone must be a solid contact.&nbsp;&nbsp; The station claiming a contact with 
another station is expected to have had his or her callsign fully and accurately 
received and transmitted by the other station, and to have copied his/her own 
call being correctly sent by the other station.&nbsp; For example, K2MGA may not 
claim credit for a QSO with a DX station who had his call as K3MGA, even though 
in many cases the DX station would QSL the contact with the correction made 
(after receiving a card from K2MGA, realizing the error and correcting his/her 
log). For a contact to count, both stations must correctly copy all of both 
callsigns.</span></p>
