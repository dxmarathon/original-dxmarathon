<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">PY2ADR: Nice to be in the DX Marathon again. TNX 
all OM who gave me the pleasure of a QSO. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">ZL2IFB: A tough year for me - too much time 
churning through regular FT8 QSOs instead of DXing!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">VK3GA: All 2018 DX Marathon QSO’s completed 
using my personal remote site in VK3, not accessible to other hams.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">W4AG: All worked using 80M and 40M four squares.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">NU8Z: And I thought conditions were bad in 
2017!&nbsp;&nbsp; Even worse in 2018, but fun as always!!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">K4EPC: First time entrant.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">ZL1BBW: First time entrant - an interesting 
year.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">AC7P: FT8 to the rescue.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">CX3AL: It is my first entry to the DX Marathon. 
My congratulations to the organization for giving a NO-CONTEST station as mine 
the opportunity to participate in a Contest.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">ZS6AI: My second time, last year was all mode 
this year an all Digital entry.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">N9TF: Not a bad DX total for a small low power 
station at the bottom of the sunspot cycle. Most all antennas occupy an area of 
about 4,875 square feet in my backyard. Only the 40/80 meter dipole extends 
beyond that with one leg just extending to a tree</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">K6YK: Not bad for bottom of the cycle!&nbsp; NO FT-8 
QSOs, all digital are RTTY.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">I4EAT: Once again single band 6 meters, I hope 
to see more participation on this band. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">DP1POL: QTH for all QSOs is the German Research 
Station &quot;Neumayer III&quot; in Antarctica, IB59UH. I regularly work there in the 
Antarctic summer. This is surely not a competitive score, but it is good fun to 
hand out another Antarctic QSO to the deserving.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">K2JL: Returned to ham radio in late 2017, hooked 
on the DX Marathon for 2018 and beyond! 100w and wires are a real challenge!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">W4HY: Second year of participation.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">WC3W: Second Year submittal. Bummer this year—no 
remote—and stinky propagation—hopefully we find a home for the remote station 
this year!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">TF3DC: Thank you for the CQ DX Marathon.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">VK4CC: Thanks for running the Marathon again. 
Always lots of fun.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">JA0DAI: The conditions on the higher bands were 
not good enough to add more entities.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">WB5WAJ: This made operating in 2018 a little 
more fun.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">W4QN: This was not a good year - my worst since 
pursuing CQ Marathon.&nbsp; Poor conditions was a major factor, however I think the 
FT-8 craze reduced normal CW activity of many DX stations and I was only chasing 
on CW.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">EA8KC: This year I have not been able to do as 
much radio as last year and as I would have liked, still having more power and 
better means.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">K9MM: Used FT8 almost exclusively. Great new 
mode!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">HC5VF: Very happy in the DX Marathon. All the 
best.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">WA4JQS: Was a little tougher this year in 
Kentucky with lots of storms and being deployed twice to KH6 land. Could not 
catch Zones 29 and 34 at all this year but had a great time.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">TF3JB: What an excellent event. My SteppIR 
SmallIR vertical broke down in March 2018. Consequently, no QSO's for several 
months until I discovered the Omniangle OA-50 antenna from Par Electronics for 
50 MHz for 6 meters.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">IK5FKF: Year 2018 characterized by absence of 
sunspots and the new digital mode FT8 that Big Stations and DXPeditions have 
used a lot. I could not compete with them. Result: after 10 years I will not be 
in the TOP 5. Good luck in 2019.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri"><span style="line-height: 107%">
<font size="4">VE9VIC: </font></span>
<span lang="EN-CA" style="line-height: 107%"><font size="4">It’s my first year, 
next year I will try to improve my antenna, during the summer I work 70 hours a 
week but in winter I have fun.</font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">HA0 0001: Marathon is always a good contest! 
Know SWLs are not participate (yet?) but a big pleasure to see my scores at the 
listings.&nbsp; At 2018 heard 7 new entities and two are confirmed with paper card: 
KH1/KH7Z at 20m and 3B7A on 6 bands with 2 modes.&nbsp; And heard Montana the last 
missing state for complete heard all states after over 5 years SWLing.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">VE4HAZ: Thanks for what you do with the DX 
Marathon.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">SP3BGD: <span class="5yl5">It was nice to see 
friends on the air.&nbsp; I am sending everyone 73. HNY 2019</span></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">PY2CP: CQ DX Marathon is growing and will even 
more....Count on me!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">W4CU: This past year my good friend and Elmer, 
N4RI, became an SK.&nbsp; As you know, he regularly placed in the top five or ten in 
the Formula Class running 100 watts to dipoles for each band.&nbsp; What you probably 
do not know is that his dipoles were all contained in a small condo attic.&nbsp; His 
antennas His 40 and 30 meter antennas were bent in various directions to fit in 
the attic, and he worked long and hard to minimize the interactions of 7 dipoles 
in that confined space.&nbsp; He made up for his working conditions through skill and 
determination.&nbsp; In addition to his love for DX,&nbsp;Scotty was a regular at the CW 
table for field day, and participated with the St. Petersburg Amateur Radio Club 
(SPARC) in CW and RTTY&nbsp;contests.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Calibri" size="4">WA4JQS: Thank you for all 
you do for us with the Marathon each year.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Calibri" size="4">IZ5CML: Quite happy about 
my score, just &quot;traditional&quot; mode in the year of FT8 explosion and deep solar 
minimum, I started to pay attention of country in my log just after the CQWW SSB 
end October and follow actively the DX Marathon, lost at least 15 Countries, so 
not too bad activity during the year!<span style="line-height: 107%">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">WX6V: Competing in the Marathon every year is 
what &quot;floats my boat&quot; as a DXer and has been doing so for some time now.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">N4ANV: I would like to tell you that I really 
love the DX Marathon, and still will operate next year,&nbsp;even though I am 79, and 
have a real problem of memory, and some medical issues.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Calibri" size="4">K4IQJ: I worked hard on my 
160M Marathon this past year, probably my best score.&nbsp; I checked the website 
today to get the forms only to find out the deadline is past.&nbsp; There is no way I 
can ever meet the 5 day deadline since we typically spend several days away from 
home over New Years, and it typically takes a few days to produce a correct log 
among all the rest of the stuff that needs to be done to start the year.&nbsp; There 
is no reason to participate any more.<span style="line-height: 107%">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">K7ACZ: I do not have a great score, I just 
wanted to support the contest, so you can make me a late log.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">N4KC: This is my first year to participate in 
the Marathon, and with the grid chase and a couple of pretty good contest 
efforts, I thought I might have a middlin’ score. </span></font></p>
