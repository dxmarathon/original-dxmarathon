		<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 Meters 
		was alive and well in 2014!&nbsp; Although the propagation forecasts at the 
		beginning of the year looked poor, many participants in the 2014 edition 
		of the DX Marathon kept their dials set to 10 meters.&nbsp; Over 25% of all 
		QSO’s submitted in the Marathon were on 10m - double the quantity from 
		2013.&nbsp; 12m QSO’s were also up significantly.&nbsp; The 10, 12, &amp; 15m bands 
		accounted for 55% of all Marathon QSOs. &nbsp;&nbsp;That is the highest percentage 
		ever seen in the Marathon. Let’s hope these good conditions continue 
		into 2015. Average scores were down slightly from last year, reflecting 
		the greater seasonal variations of the higher frequency bands and an 
		increased number of entrants pursuing single band awards. &nbsp;However, 
		participation in the Marathon grew 5% in 2014, thanks primarily to the 
		addition of the new Limited Class.&nbsp; This new class was claimed by over 
		15% of entrants, most of whom previously would have been required to 
		enter in Unlimited Class.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Marathon committee will continue to 
		evaluate all entry classes.&nbsp; We would like to extend a special welcome 
		to the 38 entrants from Turkey – a huge increase over previous years.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
		<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Single band 
		submissions on 10 meters were almost 3 times as many in 2013, although 
		single band activity on the low bands decreased.&nbsp; CW remains the most 
		popular DX Marathon mode, with just under 50% of all QSOs made on CW. 
		&nbsp;Twice as many entrants entered as Digital only compared to last year.&nbsp; 
		Overall, a total of 292 countries and 40 zones were available in 2014 
		for a maximum possible score of 332.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, the number of 
		active countries continues to drop each year, but Marathon competition 
		was the toughest yet, with the winning score only one point less than 
		2013!</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>
		<span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">And the Winners 
		Are….</span></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Since his first entry in the 
		Marathon in 2011, Tony, IK0OZD has been a major contender.&nbsp; He won the 
		overall Unlimited Class in 2011 and won the CW plaque for Top CW score 
		in 2012.&nbsp; For 2014, Tony was the sole leader with a top score of 329 – 
		he missed only 3 countries.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were quite a few countries in 2014 
		that made only a very few QSO’s: E5 (North Cook), KH9, VP6, VP8 S. 
		Georgia and TL.&nbsp; Ultimately, those countries made the difference between 
		the top positions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wayne, N0UN and Bill, K2TQC, both came in one point 
		behind Tony at 328 points.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of ties, standings are 
		determined by the date of the last country worked.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sam, UT9FJ, had the 
		incredible score of 327 using only 100 watts and a vertical!&nbsp; 
		Fortunately his vertical is quite high in the air.&nbsp; Rounding out the top 
		five were EA1DR and OK2PAY who were tied for 5<sup>th</sup> at 326 
		points.&nbsp; Congratulations to each of these top scorers – we know you 
		spent many hours in front of your radios!</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">2014 was the first year for 
		the new Limited Class which is designed for those running 100 watts and 
		small, low directional antennas.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are very pleased with the 
		participation in Limited Class in its inaugural year.&nbsp; Egidio, IZ8BRI, 
		is the first winner of the Limited Class plaque with a score of 310.&nbsp; 
		R6YY and W2NK claimed 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> place with 
		scores of 298 and 282, respectively.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Formula Class scores 
		continue to climb each year, along with participation.&nbsp; In 2014, Ruslan, 
		UR5IRM, claims the number one position in the 100 watt section with an 
		amazing score of 312 – 2 points higher than last year’s top Formula 
		Class score.&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe, W4TV was again runner-up with a score of 303, 
		followed by N4RI at 272. &nbsp;In the 5 watts or less section, Dan, WG5G, had 
		the top score for the third year in a row!&nbsp;&nbsp; Dan’s winning score was 280 
		– very impressive for only 5 watts!&nbsp; Congratulations to all of our 
		Formula Class participants.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">The single mode competitions 
		continue to attract additional participants, especially in Digital and 
		Phone modes.&nbsp; Dan, KB0EO, lead the CW competition with a score of 307 
		out of a maximum possible score of 315.&nbsp; F5IN was close behind at 303 
		points.&nbsp; In the Phone category, Gert, PA2LO, finished on top with a 
		score of 302.&nbsp;&nbsp; N3CDA was close behind at 298 points.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Digital only 
		category attracted over twice as many participants as last year and 
		Piero, IK5FKF, will receive the plaque for digital with the top score of 
		263.&nbsp; N5MOA was runner-up at 257 points.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">&nbsp;Plaques are also awarded 
		for the highest scores on the 10-80 meter bands and for the top 
		continental scores.&nbsp; As always, there were some very impressive single 
		band scores and plenty of competition. &nbsp;LU5FF’s score of 118 on 6 
		meters, PY5EG’s score of 289 on 10 meters, LY2FN’s 272 points on 12 
		meters and W9KNI’s 316 points on 17 meters are new all-time high scores 
		for those bands. &nbsp;The Europe and North America competitions were also 
		very close, with only five points separating the top five positions in 
		Europe and the top three positions in North America. &nbsp;Three new Zone 
		records were set as well, with TG9AJR in Zone 7, UT9FJ in Zone 16 and 
		TF3DC in Zone 40 all being added to the DX Marathon all-time record 
		books. As always, we sincerely appreciate the tremendous support of all 
		of our plaque sponsors.&nbsp; If you or someone you know would like to become 
		a DX Marathon plaque sponsor, please contact the author directly.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Certificates will be given 
		to the top scorer in each country and zone, plus the 6 and 160 meter top 
		scorers, for those who did not already qualify as a plaque winner. &nbsp;In 
		the DX Marathon Club competition, once again the Araucaria DX Group in 
		Brazil took top honors with a total score of 5,951. &nbsp;The Carolina DX 
		Association was not far behind with a score of 5,074.&nbsp; If you are a 
		member of a radio club, be sure to include your club affiliation in your 
		submission.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Throughout each competition 
		year, the DX Marathon website publishes a long list of bad spots, 
		pirates and other information to help every participant eliminate or 
		reduce errors.&nbsp; In 2014, that list totaled over 500 callsigns.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps 
		not everyone is aware of the list as many of the bad calls shown 
		appeared in many logs.&nbsp; The 2014 error rate was up slightly from last 
		year at 2.05%.&nbsp; The top spots in many categories are often only one or 
		two points apart, so even one error can be significant. &nbsp;Unfortunately, 
		85% of all entrants had at least one point subtracted from their 
		submitted score.&nbsp; In 2014, one third of all subtractions were due to 
		entry of the wrong country for the callsign worked.&nbsp;&nbsp; The wrong country 
		error rate was up from last year and can be largely attributed to the 
		Russian Olympic callsigns.&nbsp;&nbsp; The error rates on those callsigns were 
		very high. The Olympic callsigns did not always follow the traditional 
		Russian prefixes and unless a logging program database specifically 
		included the unique callsigns, mistakes were easily made.&nbsp; Please update 
		your country database files before submitting your score!</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">The highest error category 
		(although down from last year) was busted (28%) and invalid (18%) calls 
		accounting for 46% of all subtractions. Most of these errors were due to 
		mis-copying of callsigns or logging spots that had errors.&nbsp; Never log a 
		DX spot without carefully listening to the callsign that the DX station 
		is sending.&nbsp; For each busted call subtraction, we can provide the 
		callsign of the actual station that was worked.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Wrong zone errors were also 
		higher this year.&nbsp; A large number of Zone errors came from the various 
		W1AW/X operations.&nbsp; For example, W1AW/4 and W1AW/8 could be Zone 4 or 
		Zone 5.&nbsp; W1AW/7 could be Zone 4 or Zone 3.&nbsp; Since the call area 
		designator is no longer required to match a station’s actual location in 
		the U.S., a manual check on QRZ.COM or in the FCC database is often 
		required.&nbsp; There are also a number of stations with KL, KP and KH 
		prefixes that actually live in the lower 48 states.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zone 2 is always a 
		major problem as well and the DX Marathon web site has a separate 
		section dedicated to help determine whether that VE2 station is in Zone 
		2 or 5.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
		<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">With a database of over 
		110,000 QSO’s, there is a lot of information and data available. &nbsp;We 
		will continue to analyze all QSO’s that took place in the 2014 Marathon 
		and include a summary of facts on the DX Marathon website.&nbsp; For example, 
		only 349 QSO’s took place with Zone 2 in 2014, so one third of all 
		entrants missed zone 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Zone 2 remains the most difficult zone to work 
		in the Marathon.&nbsp; &nbsp;Winning the Marathon often means working those 
		countries that only make a few QSO’s each year.&nbsp; There were three 
		countries that between them accounted for only 12 QSO’s.&nbsp; Working those 
		rare countries can be quite a challenge!&nbsp; If there are other statistics 
		our readers would be interested in seeing, please contact the author.</span></p>
