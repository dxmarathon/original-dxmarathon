<span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">I was off the air with 
antenna issues most of the year, but this looks like fun so I'll be back…….<b>W6OGC</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Thank you for the wonderful contest again this year…..<b>N7RD</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you 
for your efforts with the DX marathon Award…..<b>NU8Z</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>

&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Good fun again this year…..<b>VK4CC</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Logger32’s in-year DXCC support helped me enormously, flagging new ones on 
DXcluster and the band maps….<b>ZL2IFB</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not even know about my 
opportunity to submit until Oct.&nbsp; At the Chattanooga Hamfest, I found a $1 used 
copy of “A Year of DX” by W9KNI.&nbsp; I was pleasantly surprised to learn of the DX 
Marathon program, and better yet – that I had a sizable entry in the QRP 
class…..<b>K4AR</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This is my first entry and I had a great time…..<b>W5IF</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I think the Marathon is the best test od DXing we have.&nbsp; It takes time, talent 
and equipment to place with a good score…..<b>N4ANV</b>.&nbsp; I just learned about 
the DX Marathon in December, so now that I’m aware of it, hopefully my score 
will be better for 2017…….<b>N6RW</b>.&nbsp; T</span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">his 
is an never ending source of fun and excitement for DX chasers like me…..<b>K7BV</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Really expected to have done better this year, but since mid-October have had an 
s6-7 noise level and can't find out where it is coming from…..<b>K9CJ</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">As I know that Mel 
SM0MPV beat me in Mixed I decided to go for digital only this year.&nbsp; 73 from 
snowy Sweden…..<b>SM5DJZ</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; My score is pretty low at 29 points but it gives 
me a benchmark for future DX Marathons……<b>K5ATG</b>.&nbsp; </span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Condx this year not so good. Missed 
a few Far East stations……<b>VE3CRG</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Was an interesting 
exercise to go through and look back at 2016, also interesting to take a look at 
DXKeeper. Found a couple of errors on final check.&nbsp; 73 from New Caledonia…..<b>FK1TS.</b>&nbsp; 
&nbsp;Thanks for running the Marathon and keeping me focused on DX'ing….<b>N3QE</b>.&nbsp;
</span><span lang="EN" style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">I participated in 
the CQ Contests, but I did not know about the DX Marathon.&nbsp; I read EA1DR’s 
article in the URE magazine and I have done everything possible to participate.&nbsp; 
I hope to participate in future editions…..<b>EB3WH</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Not too good this&nbsp;year due to little 
on air time…..</span><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">W4CU</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This is my tenth DX Marathon!&nbsp; The year was difficult. But despite the downward 
solar activity many successful contacts were made with many areas…..<b>R6YY</b>.&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Just found out about the 
Marathon a couple weeks ago, or would&nbsp;have done better……<b>AI7KC</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; T</span><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">hanks 
for this activity and hope to enter more for 2017 entry…..<b>W9IXX</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 160m 
propagation improved during the year, We are now back to the beginning of low 
solar cycle years, Much more fun ahead for 2017….<b>N4IS</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 1st year in 
Marathon - lots of fun - and frustration.&nbsp; Missed quite a few “easy” ones, and I 
could not recover as condx went down later in the year….<b>K2ZJ</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 5W QRP 
using Flex-1500 SDR.&nbsp; All QSOs 20m JT65 mode….<b>G8JQW</b>.&nbsp; A hard year but 
very satisfying.&nbsp; Band conditions well down but still managed to pull out some 
new ones…..<b>GI4SJQ</b>.&nbsp; A new challenge for me! That was fun! Thanks very 
much….<b>PA0INA</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always fun doing the Marathon. Not as good as last two 
years but still fun. Hope for a better 2017….<b>WA4JQS.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bands were 
way down from previous years, still had fun…..<b>WG5G</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; CONDX have been 
poor under 0 SSN! Let’s hope it will improve in 2017….<b>JA0DAI</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; First 
time entering the CQ DX Marathon.&nbsp; Looking forward to improving my score in 
2017…..<b>W4ER</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First time entering the Marathon; never gave it much 
thought in the past. I do enough contesting now that I can actually rack up a 
respectable score. Thanks to AD1C for his very nice ADIF conversion program….<b>NA6O</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
First time entrant, hope to be active in 2017…..<b>WT2P</b>.&nbsp; Fun contest but 
time consuming. Once you start you can’t miss a day without listening. Simple 
vertical antenna here…..<b>N8MZ</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Great fun even for a little pistol…..<b>AJ8B</b>.&nbsp; 
Had a ball on 40, limited only by poor propagation late in the year….<b>K5TF</b>.&nbsp; 
Had a great time this year. Wish I could have worked China for zone 24. I did 
get 17 more entities than 2 years ago when condx were better<b>….K4IE</b>.&nbsp; Had 
fun doing this.&nbsp; Gave me a new Challenge…..<b>WB1ASL.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>I enjoy this 
contest each and every year.&nbsp; It is one thing that keep me excited in the hunt 
for DX each and every year…..<b>N7RD</b>.&nbsp; I heard about this near the end of 
this year, and have spent a good part of the 2016 with no antenna.&nbsp; It sounds 
like fun, so now with better antennas in the New Year, I'll be back…..<b>W6OGC</b>.&nbsp; 
It was a good operation from Easter Island (CE0Y), thanks to all who contacted 
me…..<b>CB0Y</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many thanks for the QSOs…..<b>K4WES</b>.&nbsp; Propagation was 
not that favorable so not much DX activity.&nbsp; Enjoyed chasing rare DX such as 
VK0EK, FT4JA, VP8SGI and VP8STI…..<b>VU3NXI</b>.&nbsp; Score way down from 2015. I 
enjoy this challenge each year. Many thanks for all the work that is done to 
make it successful…..<b>K5BG</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Second Year submittal….<b>WC3W</b>.&nbsp; The 
year started off good but became harder and harder toward the end.&nbsp; By October I 
felt lucky to make any DX contacts in a day.&nbsp; This and other CQ and ARRL 
contests have made me want to study everything I can do to try to improve.&nbsp; 
Since I live in an HOA my antenna situation is very challenging…..<b>N5ZY</b>.&nbsp; 
2016 was the first year I participated in the Marathon. It was most interesting 
to monitor the number of countries and zones worked day by day and month my 
month.&nbsp; The Marathon is quite a bright idea and I will most certainly 
participate in 2017. Sincere thanks to those who initiated this interesting 
event and also of course to CQ Magazine…..<b>TF3JB</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another FB year's 
DXing despite declining sunspots and conditions, I equaled last year's score.&nbsp; 
The few I missed were simply too weak down here.&nbsp; I'm in awe of those who beat 
me!&nbsp; As I write this, I'm already chasing new ones in 2017 - and so the fun 
continues…..<b>ZL2IFB</b>.&nbsp; I did not quite reach my score of the previous year, 
but I am still very happy to collect more than 100 DXCC entities from Antarctica 
within one year in very poor propagation conditions.&nbsp; Trying out JT9 and JT65 
helped me get a few new countries into the log when the propagation path was 
marginal…..<b>DP1POL</b>.&nbsp; I wasn't going to enter this year until October 1 
when I decided to make a 3 month run at single band 40 meters.&nbsp; Unfortunately, 
the propagation died the second half of the year - although I picked up a couple 
of rare ones (VU7MS, 8Q7SP, VQ9SC) during some brief openings. I missed a lot of 
stuff that I just couldn't hear - SU, 9N7, XU, XV, XW, XZ, XX9, UK, EK, EY, etc. 
- they were all frequently spotted, but no openings.&nbsp;&nbsp; I missed my objective of 
breaking a total score of 250 - I'm just hoping to crack the top 5 for this 
entry…..<b>KB0EO.</b>&nbsp; My first time participating in the DX Marathon. Next year 
I'll try to do something different… Thanks for the organization of the event…..<b>EA2BD.</b>&nbsp; 
Some poor conditions but some nice surprises too…..<b>GI4DOH</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for 
running the Marathon (pun intended) again in 2016. &nbsp;The cycle is waning but the 
fun is still there…..<b>VK4CC</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the continued opportunity to 
improve my operating skills<b>….KD4LEM</b>.&nbsp; Thanks for the DX Marathon 
program.&nbsp; Great way to keep operating interest up during very trying propagation 
conditions<b>….. AC7P</b>.&nbsp; Thanks to the DX Marathon I was able to QRV actively 
throughout the year….<b>JA2NDQ</b>.&nbsp; The bands have terrible here.&nbsp; I could hear 
others working stations and I could not even tell there was any one there, but 
guess what it was still fun…..<b>N4ANV</b>……This has been a good event. I 
appreciate the opportunity to look back at my operations for the year 2016…...<b>WA5KBH.</b>&nbsp; 
This is my first DX Marathon and hopefully not my last.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to take time off 
to help take care of a sick dad but it has been a productive year nonetheless……<b>NY4G.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my first DX Marathon. My first ever HF contact was on 10 January 
2016. All contacts recorded were made using 5 or fewer watts with an Elecraft K2 
and a homebrew 20 meter inverted V wire dipole. All contacts were made in PSK31 
as a digital mode……<b>K5ATG.</b>&nbsp; This is my first effort to the DX Marathon, I 
know I missed few entities who were QRV during 2016, but I tried to do my best……<b>I4EAT</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
This is my first participation. I hope to improve the score in the next year. It 
is very important consider the handicap of the little pistols -Limited power and 
limited aluminum in a contest……<b>EA2HW.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the first time I've 
decided to enter. I wasn't even planning to enter but saw a reminder to submit 
by January 10 so I figured I'd make it before the deadline. Maybe this year I'll 
actually try to work on this for real…..<b>K2DBK</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you DX Marathon 
for another year in competition…..<b>IK5FKF</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the sunspots may be 
fewer, DXpeditions and contest operations from rare spots have kept me very 
close to the rig all year…..<b>VE9CB</b>.&nbsp; Working 30m band and CW only was a 
lot of fun…..<b>I4TJE.</b></span></p>
