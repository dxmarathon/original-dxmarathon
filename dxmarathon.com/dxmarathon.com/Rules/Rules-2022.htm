<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">The CQ DX Marathon is designed to promote DXing 
activity throughout the year rather than only on contest weekends and during 
DXpeditions. Because activity is not concentrated in specific time periods, 
credit is given for contacts on all ham bands, including those not normally used 
for contesting (e.g., 60, 30, 17 &amp; 12 meters).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">Scoring is simple: you score one point the first 
time you work a new country and/or a new zone during the year. Add the points up 
at the end of the year for your total score. There are no multipliers. </span>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">Here are the complete rules:</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Activity period:</b>&nbsp; The CQ DX 
Marathon is a yearlong activity, beginning at 0000 UTC January 1 and ending at 
2359 UTC December 31.&nbsp; Each year’s event is separate.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Frequencies:</b>&nbsp; Any authorized 
amateur frequency may be used.&nbsp; Contacts through repeaters or satellites are not 
allowed for credit, nor are contacts with maritime or aeronautical mobile 
stations.&nbsp; All contacts must be made entirely over amateur radio frequencies – 
i.e., Echolink-type contacts do not count.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Modes:</b>&nbsp; Any authorized amateur 
mode may be used, but three modes will be recognized in the DX Marathon – <b>CW, 
Phone</b> <b>and Digital</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Except for single mode submissions, cross-mode 
QSO’s are permitted but the mode used by the DX station must be shown in the 
submission.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>General: </b>&nbsp;Each entrant in the DX 
Marathon may submit one log each year per operating location.&nbsp; Participants 
submitting logs for single-mode or single-band entries must include only those 
contacts in their submission.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logs submitted with multiple modes or multiple 
bands will not be considered for single-mode or single-band awards.&nbsp; Entries 
with two or more call signs will count as a single entry only if all contacts 
were made by the same (single) operator at the same station using the same 
antennas, and each callsign used is listed in the comments section of the 
submission form.&nbsp; Remote operation is permitted if all transmitters, receivers, 
and antennas are at a <b>single </b>physical location.&nbsp; A remote station in a 
different country than the entrant's country of license must comply with all 
local laws and regulations.&nbsp; If an entrant operates from both a primary station 
and a remote station, separate entries for each location may be submitted 
provided such separate entries have different callsigns or a portable callsign 
designator. &nbsp;Entries that include contacts made with the assistance of remote 
receivers and/or transmitters in addition to contacts from a primary station are 
not permitted.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>
<span style="line-height: 107%">Categories</span></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three entry classes, “Formula,” 
“Limited” and “Unlimited.” </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><font face="Arial"><b>
<span style="line-height: 107%"><font size="4">Formula:</font></span></b><span style="line-height: 107%"><font size="4"> 
An entrant may choose one of two options in this class: (1) All contacts must be 
made with a maximum output power of 5 watts, regardless of band or mode; or (2) 
the operator may run a maximum of 100 watts output to a simple antenna, such as 
a vertical or dipole (see the appendix below for further rules on antennas used 
in either option for Formula Class).&nbsp; An operator in Formula Class must select 
QRP (5 watts or less) or 100 watts and limited antennas at the beginning of the 
year’s DX Marathon and may not switch between entry modes during the year.&nbsp; All 
contacts must be made without the use of higher power or prohibited antennas to 
initially secure the contact.&nbsp; Use of spotting nets such as a DX Cluster® is 
allowed.&nbsp; Details of antennas used in either option of Formula Class must be 
included on the official submission form to qualify for Formula Class. Formula 
Class entries without antenna descriptions (type, height, and length, for 
example) may be re-classified to Unlimited Class.</font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Limited:</b>&nbsp; Limited Class entrants 
are allowed a maximum output power of 100 watts and simple antennas, such as 
verticals or dipoles, plus small directional antennas such as Yagis and 
multi-element loop, hex and quad type antennas for the 6-, 10-, 12-, 15-,17- and 
20-meter bands, and single-element rotatable dipoles for the 30- and 40-meter 
bands.&nbsp; See the Appendix below for further description of the Limited Class 
antennas that are allowed.&nbsp; All contacts must be made without the use of higher 
power or prohibited antennas to initially secure the contact.&nbsp; Use of spotting 
nets such as a DX Cluster® is allowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Details of antennas used in Limited 
Class must be included on the official submission form to qualify for Limited 
Class. Limited Class entries without antenna descriptions (type, height, and 
length, for example) may be re-classified to Unlimited Class.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Unlimited:</b>&nbsp; Any antenna or 
antennas may be used, along with any power level for which the operator is 
licensed.&nbsp; Use of spotting nets such as DX Cluster® is allowed. &nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4"><b>
<span style="line-height: 107%">Scoring</span></b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each country worked is worth one point.&nbsp; 
Each CQ zone worked is worth one point.&nbsp; The total score is the sum of zones and 
countries worked on any mode and any authorized band.&nbsp; There are no multipliers 
of any kind.&nbsp; Each country and zone count only once.&nbsp; A single QSO may count for 
both a country and a zone.&nbsp; If in the year you work 238 countries and 37 zones, 
your score is 275.&nbsp; If you work all 40 zones and 150 countries, your score is 
190.&nbsp; The CQ DX Countries List and the CQ Zone List constitute the official 
lists.&nbsp; The lists are available on the DX Marathon web site.&nbsp; In the case of 
ties, the operator whose last scoring contact was earlier chronologically will 
be judged the winner.&nbsp; Decisions of the DX Marathon Manager are final. </span>

<span style="line-height: 107%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Verification:</b> QSLs are not 
required.&nbsp; The operator is expected to claim contacts only from stations the 
operator has every reason to believe are legitimate, and only to claim contacts 
in which an accurate two-way exchange was clearly accomplished (see Appendix for 
further explanation).&nbsp; Scores will be adjusted by the DX Marathon committee for 
claimed contacts with pirates or any station not considered legitimate.&nbsp; 
Submissions may be penalized or voided in cases of fraud or poor sportsmanship. 
Every QSO may be subject to verification by the DX Marathon Manager. Decisions 
of the DX Marathon Manager are final. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Clubs: </b>Clubs are strongly

<span style="line-height: 107%"><font size="4">Formula Class antennas, option 1:</font></span></b><span style="line-height: 107%"><font size="4"> 
Operators selecting the 5-watt option are limited to antennas on a single tower 
and whose height does not exceed 65 feet or 20 meters above ground elevation.&nbsp; 
Wire antennas may also be used but must meet the criteria of the 100-watt option 
and may be tower-supported at only one point. </font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in"><font face="Arial"><b>
<span style="line-height: 107%"><font size="4">Formula Class antennas, option 2:</font></span></b><span style="line-height: 107%"><font size="4"> 
Antennas for operators choosing the 100-watt option must be either simple 
verticals or wire antennas lacking significant gain.&nbsp; No arrays are allowed, 
whether vertical or horizontal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wire antennas, regardless of type, may not 
exceed 130 feet or 40 meters in length, may not be higher than 65 feet or 20 
meters above ground at any point of the antenna and may be tower-supported at 
only one point.&nbsp; The tallest point of vertical antennas used may not be higher 
than 65 feet or 20 meters above ground.&nbsp; Yagis, quads and rotatable dipoles may 
not be used in this category.&nbsp; There is no limit on the number of antennas that 
may be used if each antenna meets the above criteria. </font></span></font></p>

Antennas for Limited Class include all Formula Class option 2 antennas for use 
on all bands plus directional antennas such as Yagis and multi-element loop, hex 
and quad type antennas on the 20- through 6-meter bands.&nbsp; Directional antennas 
with no more than 3 elements per band are allowed on the 20- through 6-meter 
bands.&nbsp; Boom length may not exceed 16 feet (5 meters) for antennas with booms.&nbsp; 
Single-element rotatable dipoles are allowed for the 30- and 40-meter bands.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Directional antennas and rotatable dipoles must not be higher than 50 feet (15 
meters) above ground and all directional antennas must be on a single tower or

Each contact for a claimed country or zone must be a solid contact.&nbsp; The station 
claiming a contact with another station is expected to have had his or her 
callsign fully and accurately received and transmitted by the other station, and 
to have copied his/her own call being correctly sent by the other station.&nbsp; For 
example, K2MGA may not claim credit for a QSO with a DX station who had his call 
as K3MGA, even though in many cases the DX station would QSL the contact with 
the correction made (after receiving a card from K2MGA, realizing the error, and 
correcting his/her log).&nbsp; For a contact to count, both stations must correctly 
copy both callsigns completely. </font></span></font></p>
