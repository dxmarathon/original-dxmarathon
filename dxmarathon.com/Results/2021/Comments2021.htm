<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">W9AP: A great first-time experience. Would like 
to have worked more countries - not enough butt in seat time. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">NU8Z: DX Better than 2020. Few more DX-peditions 
and better conditions. Had fun. Looking forward to next year.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">GW3SFC:&nbsp; Enjoyed 2021 CQ Marathon. My first 
entry. Worked several new ones towards end. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">IN3FHE: Every year my local noise/QRM is worse. 
It's a hard job to be satisfied with the Marathon.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">VK2EY: First Time entry - a lot of fun</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">W4HY: Fourth year of participation. </span>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">K9RR:&nbsp; Fun every year. Can't wait for the 2022 
edition to start.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">N0FW: Glad to participate again this year.&nbsp; It 
was a pleasant break from all the issues going on in the world.&nbsp; CU again next 
year!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">NL8F: &nbsp; Great contest keeps you on your toes</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">ON6NL: Great motivation tool to keep you hunting 
for DX!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">KI1U: Great to see conditions improving!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">4F3BZ: Happy to have broken the country record. 
Looking forward to 2022! 73</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">N6WT: I am just going to turn this in as is. I 
have not checked for valid calls or pirates. I was not as active as the year 
before due to a whole house remodel. My shack was disassembled for 3 months. I 
hope to do better in 2022! TNX 73 Kent</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">JA0DAI: I think FT8 is the most useful mode for 
low level signals on 160m and 6m, and I like it.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">W2NK: I was disappointed by the lack of activity 
from so many of the usual common countries that I never heard this year. 8P,9H, 
FP, J3, J7 etc. Are all the mini-DX-peditions only taking digi with them?</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">K4ZO: Improved my score from last year but still 
missed a few.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">OE1SGU: It was great fun again! 73 Hannes </span>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">IT9RYJ:&nbsp; It's the first time I submit my log to 
CQ DX Marathon. I think that this competition is a very good idea in order to 
develop DX activity!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">MI0BHX: Looking forward to receiving a high 
place in the results table.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">KW9U: Moved this year and missed about 3 months 
operating time. Only moved about 5 miles. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">K1NU:&nbsp; My first try at the Marathon - had a 
blast, but it was exhausting.&nbsp; Managed to (barely!) make my goal of 200 DXCC 
entities.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">WG5G:&nbsp; Poor propagation, covid kept scores down 
but had fun, looking forward to 2022 â€“ come on sunspots.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">AD0K:&nbsp; First time submitting. First year using 
FT-8 and FT-4. Conditions are getting better, with SFI over 100 at the end of 
the year, but most of the year SFI was around 70. Tough propagation conditions. 
Things are looking better for 2022.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">N9TF:&nbsp; This year I changed my residence from IL 
to TN for retirement.&nbsp; I chose to use DX worked in TN over IL. I was quite happy 
and impressed with what I was able to accomplish with a quickly cobbled together 
160m (sort of) dipole.&nbsp;&nbsp; All contacts claimed were made from FN22. I have an 
entry for CN87 that is separate from this one as CN87 is my home QTH.&nbsp; If I 
understand the rules correctly, I can't combine the logs but hope that KB2S/2 
counts as a different callsign for the entry.&nbsp; But I sure can't wait to get some 
real antennas up this spring! FT8/4 was my friend, although I did manage 7 
entities of the 80 on CW.&nbsp; Many of the FT contacts would have been possible on 
CW, if there was activity on that mode!&nbsp; Thanks CQ group for a fun contest.&nbsp; 
Looking forward to 2022 and more sunspots. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">IW2CAM: This year participating is for me the 
last one. Every year in the past I and my friend Fausto I4EAT we decided 
together if to participate. Unfortunately in March 2021 Fausto went Silent Key 
due to COVID-19.&nbsp; Because of our strong friendship (we knew each other from 50 
years) and we were like brothers,&nbsp; I decided to participate in his honour to the 
2021 DX Marathon&nbsp; and to close here my participation to this competition.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">KO4EJD: First time. I had to start over because 
we left Florida and came back to AZ.&nbsp; Changed antennas at the end of the year 
and realized I just moved myself out of the limited category because I started 
using a 203' End Fed wire.&nbsp; Now I know the length limit and will begin testing a 
new wire antenna.&nbsp; Thanks for a great time.&nbsp; It was a blast.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">R6YY: In 2021, I scored 298 points in UNLIMITED 
class. But I decided to apply in the DIGITAL group. I declare 277 points. The 
past year was tense. Covid-19 imposed a heavy imprint on our entire lives.&nbsp; 
Nevertheless, with great pleasure and perhaps the only aspiration continue to 
participate in the CQ DX Marathon. I congratulate all the colleagues with the 
New 2022 and wish you success.&nbsp; Many thanks to John K9EL and all members of the 
team of the organizers of the Marathon for their altruism.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">W7AOF:&nbsp; I'm Furkan, 24 years old. I did my first 
QSO on April 13, 2021. This is my first time participating in the CQ Marathon.&nbsp; 
If there was a youth category, I'm sure I would be the winner. I thought about 
joining in the digital category.&nbsp; But I want a regional winner in the mixed 
category. I hope I earn a certificate. I wish everyone success.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">ZL2IFB: The Marathon keeps me running all year, 
well jogging anyway, more like a gentle amble along the beach most of the time.&nbsp; 
My sprinting days are over!&nbsp; I'd be lost without Logger32 plus Club Log's annual 
league tables and AD1C's Marathon log converter.&nbsp; Thanks for running the 
Marathon, maintaining the website and dropping occasional hints via the 
reflector about pirates, busted calls, DXpeditions and so forth.&nbsp; Thanks also to 
everyone I worked in 2021, points or no points.&nbsp; With the HF DX community for 
company, being locked down in my shack during COVID is not so bad after all!&nbsp;
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">IK5FKF:&nbsp; Since 2009 I have always participated 
in the Digital category (4 times winner),â€¦ thanks CQ DX Marathon.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">WX0Z: Solar conditions improved in 2021 â€“ I 
worked 15 ATNOs. I also finally worked zone 26 and have worked all 40 zones for 
the first time.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">PU2STZ: Thank you CQ Mag for keeping us up on 
the bands with this wonderful contest. My score has improved over 2020, coming 
from 186 to this year's 209. I'll be back in 2022.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">K4AR: &nbsp; Thank you CQ Magazine, the Annual DX 
Marathon was a blast!&nbsp; 73 </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">TA4RC: Thanks for all dx amateur station best 
73's </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">VK4CC:&nbsp; Thanks for running the marathon again. 
Hopefully conditions are on the improve. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">CO2QU: Thanks you very much to the DX station to 
be a part of the fun and to deliver us new DXCC possibility.&nbsp; Thank to God 
surpass my goals for this season.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">VU2IBI: The only Contest to keep you in the 
shack &quot;Year Long&quot;.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">N4TL: This is the first time I submitted a score 
for this Marathon. 73 </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">K9IO: &nbsp;&nbsp; What a year! The bands were sounding 
better-and-better as the year progressed. All contacts FT8. Worked first Japan 
on 6 mts and first Vietnam and Thailand on 80 mts!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">N6NFB: Worked 68 countries last year, my first 
year participating. 106 is nice progress. Next year I'll have to play in 
unlimited. 73 </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Calibri" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">M0XLT: Yet another year completed and it was 
again an enjoyable one using a simple set-up.</span></font></p>
