<span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial">First ever 
submission - all SSB. Had thought about a sole 10m entry but decided against in 
the end… that’s why all zone QSO’s are 10m……..<b>M0TTB.&nbsp; T</b></span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">hanks to significantly improved conditions on the higher 
bands and a new antenna I was able to top last years score……<b>DL4CW.&nbsp; </b>
</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Thanks for sponsoring 
this great contest! Quite a challenge with my attic antenna……<b>KF0IQ.&nbsp; </b>
</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial">First time entered, but will be incentive to contact all 
those DX countries that I have contacted before……..<b>VK4GH.&nbsp; </b>This added a 
great deal of fun to 2011. I tracked every dx-pedition and made sure to get in 
their log…….<b>K9CT.&nbsp; </b>Better conditions for a mobile this year. Still like 
DX the old way, tune and listen.&nbsp; I want to thank you for your extra effort with 
my entry last year. Wish you had a separate mobile category……..<b>KD5JWC.&nbsp; </b>
DX Marathon - another activity to keep a retired mind busy……….<b>N4DW.&nbsp; </b>
Congratulations on a fantastic concept……<b>VE3KKB.&nbsp; </b>I actually upgraded due 
to the DX to be found in the Extra portion of the bands and this contest……..<b>N3TD.&nbsp;
</b>This was my first year back on the air after being off for 22 years, so I’m 
still learning about the whole new world that is ham radio. The Marathon didn’t 
exist in those days, but next year I’ll know how things work……<b>AF7S.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>
Thank you for another enjoyable contest.&nbsp; Thanks must also go to Dave AA6YQ, for 
his DXLab Suite which helped to track in real time the up to date score in the 
contest.&nbsp; Also to the many hams who persevered with my weak signal, &amp; let me 
into their shacks, if only for a minute or two, to make a contact.&nbsp; I hope to be 
able to submit a score next year also, so see you then…….<b>G4MUL.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>This is 
the first time I entered the Marathon and it has inspired me to work more DX……<b>DU1GM.&nbsp;
</b>Thanks for running such a great award program……<b>NW3H.&nbsp; </b>Great fun 
seeing the success line increase as the Sunspots increased. Had my best year in 
the four years I have participated in the Marathon. Great idea!! Same gear same 
antenna. I'm 88 years old and still have the spark……<b>K6TTT.&nbsp; </b>I&nbsp; surprised 
myself on the score. But I also missed a few &quot;easy&quot; ones because of dumb luck, 
not being here to operate, etc. But overall, I expect scores will be relatively 
high this year ... lots of good activity on the bands, and of course the sun god 
was helping all of us a LOT!!........<b>K8CQ.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>&nbsp;I achieved my goal of 200 
countries and 40 zones. This year I'll be working RTTY along with SSB so I'm 
upping my goal to 275 Countries…….<b>W4MJW.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>This was a lot of fun. All the 
antennas have been repaired after many years of disrepair. Bought first new rig 
in 30 years - FTDX5000, which replaced my trusty TR7. Old sol blessed us with 
great propagation. All contacts made with SSB. 2012 should be even better. 
Thanks for a great activity…….<b>WB9IWN.&nbsp; </b>I’m sending my log for a single 
band 160m. In 2011 I worked 155 countries and 37 zones on 160m.&nbsp; I would like to 
motivate more participants from the Top Band to join the Marathon…..<b>N4IS.&nbsp;
</b>&nbsp;I'm pleased to enclose my score sheet for DX Marathon 2011. Again, I used 
just an indoor attic antenna supplied with 100 watts…...<b>KE4PT.&nbsp; T</b>his is 
my first entry for the DX Marathon so I hope I have entered/submitted all 
correctly! &nbsp;It was lots of fun and it helped (along with W9KNI’s books!) to turn 
me from “hunted” into “hunter” hihi!......<b>VK4EI/VK4SWE.&nbsp; </b>It was fun.&nbsp; It 
will be interesting to see how I do……<b>VP8NO.&nbsp; </b>Nice to work stations for 
the Marathon in 2011. Will also participate&nbsp; again in 2012…..<b>HB9DDZ.&nbsp; </b>All 
QSOs are worked while mobile operation.&nbsp; I'm enjoying the contest through the 
year…….<b>JA7OXR/m.&nbsp; </b>Thanks for continuing to make this wonderful activity 
available for the amateur community…….<b>N8BR.&nbsp; </b>I am really trying to spread 
the word about the Marathon. A GREAT idea. It really keeps Dxing fun when I have 
over 300 confirmed. Last year I really struggled (and never succeeded) working 
3A2 for the Marathon, that was a lot of fun (like hunting for the elusive big 
one)…..<b>K3STX.&nbsp; </b>Once again I had fun chasing them but missed some 
DXpeditions due to out-of-town travel for business/family commitments - such is 
life! And I missed a few just because propagation wasn't with me and/or the 
pile-ups would allow my QRP signal to sneak through! All QSOs were worked using 
5 watts out (or less) using a tribander at 48 feet and a dipole at 45 feet 
supported by the same tower (and some convenient trees). &nbsp;It was certainly great 
to have such good conditions in October and November. If the fall of 2011 was 
any indication, 2012 should be great (and reminiscent of the &quot;good ol' days&quot;)! 
&nbsp;Thanks again for this very cool event/award. It keeps me active on a weekly 
basis (when possible) and keeps me from getting complacent…….<b>ND0C.&nbsp; </b>It´s 
a great pleasure for me to send you my log. I had been QRT for one and a half 
years after a big thunderstorm destroyed my tower and antennas. Now I have moved 
to a new QTH and I was able to put my tower and antennas back again in last 
April. Before that date was using a dipole antenna for 15 meters + tuner with 
only 100W. &nbsp;Great challenge for me to be back again on the air. Sorry my very 
low score... but in 2012 I will try to do my best……<b>PY2EL/VA3PWC.&nbsp; </b>Missed 
several countries early in 2011 due to some health issues, but I hope that's 
over and 2012 will present the opportunity to work 'em all….<b>W4VQ.&nbsp; </b>
</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial">Nice Contest……<b>CA3OEV.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I</b> only started mid year 2011 when I found the feature built into DXLAB so 
will make a big effort in 2012……<b>VK3FZ.&nbsp; </b>I was delighted to make this 
Marathon until the very last, enjoying increasing propagation this year. I just 
wish all stations could log “/QRP” suffixes when explicitly passed on the air. 
But that was fun to work all zones and almost 200 DX with such a low power. I’m 
sure that 40 zones and &gt;+ 200 DX are achievable next time, HI….<b>F8AFC.&nbsp; I</b>t 
was a lot of fun with 10 plus new all-time countries for me…..<b>WP3GW.&nbsp; </b>I 
installed 8 half wave dipoles in attic. Figured I would be lucky to get out and 
do a few countries. Now I know at 100 watts these antennas do a good job.&nbsp; The 
Marathon has done wonders for my operating. Instead of an occasional contact, I 
am busy all the time……<b>N4RI</b>.&nbsp; My suggestion is to&nbsp; allow all the entrants 
to participate in 3 classes simultaneously. It is easy for entrant to fill out 
the application in Unlimited (or Formula) Class choosing QSO’s from the log with 
preferences of one Mode and one Band at the same time. So, if you have 
appropriate program you could check all three Classes from one entry (one file). 
In my opinion in that way the motivation for participants would be much higher 
at the finish of such a long race……<b>UX1UA/UV5U.&nbsp; </b>&nbsp;Thanks for the event. It 
was fun….<b>N4NQ.&nbsp; </b>What a difference in propagation from the beginning of 
the year to the end! Early on in the year it was tough when SA was working 
VP8DMH on his one day stay to VP8/KGI and we could not hear him in the northern 
latitudes! I missed the couple of Kosovo stations that were on briefly during 
the year. [Editor Note:&nbsp; There was no Kosovo activity in 2011] &nbsp;My highlight of 
the year was when FT5XA showed up for one day from Kerguelen and I worked him on 
the long path! Woo Hoo! I think my scoresheet shows that even a W0 in the &quot;RF 
Black Hole&quot; of Minnesota can put up a decent score in the CQ Marathon……<b>NY0V.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;</b>I focused on 15m this year, with the hopes of earning DXCC on 15m. It was 
neat to see the band open up and be able to meet my goal. Perhaps good enough to 
earn another single band top honors!&nbsp; Had a Great Time!………<b>W9KVR.&nbsp; </b>2011 
was my best year since 2000…..<b>W6HYK.&nbsp; </b>&nbsp;This time I am submitting only my 
6m score…..<b>9A5CW.&nbsp; </b>It's been a good time and a lot of DXCC entities 
activated during 2011…...<b>A65CA.&nbsp; </b>First licensed in December 2010; first 
contacts on HF were in April.&nbsp; Submitting as Unlimited as my antennas are a 
couple of feet too long, and might be just over the 60' altitude limit…..<b>AB1OD.&nbsp;
</b>It was a very good year!......<b>AD1C.&nbsp; </b>I congratulate the organizers - 
new categories will certainly increase the number of participants.&nbsp; My motto is 
CW forever…….<b>E77O.&nbsp; </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;My first DX Marathon and an interesting experience. 
I had hoped to work 200 countries, as I had done in my first year mobiling in 
2001, but between conditions still not being quite as good as then, and a bit 
more restricted operating time, it was not to be. But still, I was quite happy 
with the result. If I had worked some of the big contests from my own station 
I’m sure the total would have been better, having worked a number of countries 
not on my final list and the elusive zone 2 from there. One thing that really 
surprised me was the amount of DX I was able to work on 40m, very positive 
experience.&nbsp; Thanks to CQ for organizing this fun event!......<b>EA5ON.&nbsp; </b>
First time – great fun, but missed 5 countries on the last day and forgot to QSO 
the extra EU countries!......<b>G3KMQ.&nbsp; </b>Had great fun with my 5 watts. 
&nbsp;Conditions have been very good to fair – great to have 10/12M open this time……<b>G3LHJ.&nbsp;
</b>Had intended doing an All Band/All Mode entry but lost too much time during 
September so decided to put in a half decent RTTY score……..<b>G3LZQ.&nbsp; </b>Very 
pleased to get a certificate for my efforts last year, and enjoyed the challenge 
from my small antennas &amp; limited space…….<b>G4PTJ.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>This is a new contest 
for me.&nbsp; I only discovered the web site on the 1st of January 2012.&nbsp; I think 
this is a very good idea.&nbsp; I look forward to hearing the results…..<b>GI4SJQ.&nbsp;
</b>I'm just using an old Ten Tec Argosy with 20W on 10, 15 &amp; 20, 30W on 30 &amp; 40 
and 40W on 80. I am constantly amazed what can be done with such a simple set-up 
from a built-up urban location…...<b>GM0OAA.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>I'm sorry so much that I 
didn't know about the Marathon on 1st of January 2011. I missed several entities 
when I heard them because I had QSO/QSLs from them from the previous years…….<b>HA0HW.&nbsp;
</b>My best result ever, but will do better in 2012. Thanks for the great fun……<b>IK2DJV.&nbsp; 
I</b> participated in the category &quot;DIGITAL ONLY&quot;. The best propagation 
conditions have allowed me to greatly increase the number of DXCC entities 
connected: 186 in 2009, 193 in 2010, 226 this year 2011. With this marathon I 
spent a whole year in competition……<b>IK5FKF.&nbsp; </b>This year I want try only 
digital mode and zone 2 is very rare….<b>IK5PWQ</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; My best result in 5 
years, thanks to the increased sun activity. Score could be even better: I 
missed a couple of countries just by a few minutes……<b>IW0HOU.&nbsp; </b>Thanks to 
all, I enjoyed the QSOs throughout the year as the conditions were very good in 
2011…..<b>JA3EOP.&nbsp; </b>All QSOs were worked while operating mobile. I'm enjoying 
the contest throughout the year…..<b>JA7OXR.&nbsp; </b>Lots of fun throughout the 
year……<b>K0FX.&nbsp; </b>Great fun!&nbsp; This was my first Marathon and it sure beats 
spending the year waiting for an all-time new country to show up.&nbsp; After a fast 
and furious first few months, things slowed considerably.&nbsp; But, there were some 
active months that followed.&nbsp; After a great November, December was a bust.&nbsp; I 
finished the year much better than I would have guessed and pushed the limit of 
my equipment and antennas.&nbsp; My 500 watts and wires up 80 feet won't bust any 
records in the unlimited category, but it made for the most DXing fun in many 
years…….<b>K1ESE.&nbsp; </b>Why do we have to use this official form.&nbsp; Why can't a 
form like the one generated by DXLabs be submitted as is?.......<b>K2SX.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>
All CW. Just could not get that #260.&nbsp; Oh well that is why they make a next 
year…….<b>K2UF.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>I had a GREAT time in the Marathon, it kept DXing fun. My 
entry is all CW. I only heard 4 entities that I did not work, don't know if I 
can do much better than this……<b>K3STX.&nbsp; </b>As a new ticket in 2011, Tech in 
April, General in June and Extra in November; I am pleased to have scored this 
well since I didn't have an HF rig until mid-July and recorded my first DX 
contact on Jul 23, 2011……<b>K4WSW.&nbsp; </b>Had fun again.&nbsp; Third year I have 
enjoyed improving my previous scores.&nbsp; Looking forward to 2012…..<b>K6LE.&nbsp; </b>
Great activity generator what a concept. Great fun. CU in 2012…..<b>K6XT.&nbsp; </b>
This is my best year yet since your inaugral year of the contest.&nbsp; I only wish I 
could have snagged a few more of the DXpeditions that would have given me two 
more zones and few new ones for DXCC.&nbsp; In any event, the new ones I did work 
took me over 300 DXCC worked and 292 confirmed on all bands -- not bad with my 
very modest antenna farm and less than ideal operating restrictions.&nbsp; I still 
have fun, and breaking the pile ups can often give me more of a thrill than my 
first Novice contacts in 1958.&nbsp; My score for CW ONLY was 263; Digital ONLY was 
95.&nbsp; Having the PSK and JT65 modes added to the fun.&nbsp; And highest score on ONE 
Band was 159 on 40 meters.&nbsp; Looking forward to 2012, although my effort may be 
more limited because of other commitments…..<b>K8CQ.&nbsp; </b>This was a very fun 
experience. Ran my Elecraft K3 at 5 watts output for all contacts. Didn't really 
use a lot of contests to find contacts as I seemed to be gone from home for most 
of them. Mostly just casual operating when time permitted. Thanks for putting 
this on……<b>K8NWD.&nbsp; </b>First time I've entered the Marathon and had a lot of 
fun chasing &quot;new old ones&quot;. A lot of action this year with the excellent 10 and 
12 meter conditions. Thank you for your efforts…...<b>K9NU.&nbsp; </b>This is my 
first ever entry in the Marathon.&nbsp; Thanks for sponsoring it…….<b>KG5VK.&nbsp; </b>
What an exciting year.&nbsp; The 2011 CQ WW Phone contest was very exciting and 
provided me with a good score…..<b>KJ4QDZ.&nbsp; </b>It was nice to take part one 
more time on the DX Marathon, this year I entered CW only, and I really enjoyed 
it…..<b>LU3JVO.&nbsp; </b>Great fun and my 2nd year. At last after 58 years as a ham 
I have weaned myself from ARRL logbooks and now am tracking Marathon etc. from 
10/1/2011 with DXLABS Suites. I let a few get away in 2011 and hope less get 
away this year! Great job gentlemen!.......<b>N0KE.&nbsp; </b>Had a great time seeing 
what 5 watts &amp; wire antennas could do.&nbsp; Took lots of persistence &amp; patience, but 
surpassed my original goal and contacted 180 countries &amp; 36 zones……<b>N3CU.&nbsp; </b>
CW Only. This is my first contest and it was fun. It got a lot more fun in 
September when the sun spots increased and 10 Meters opened up. I am definitely 
going to keep playing in these events. Thank you CQ…….<b>N4NQ.&nbsp; </b>I found no 
stations active from Zone 2 in spite of being active in all major DX contests (CQWW, 
ARRL DX etc) it was a disappointment not to work all zones.&nbsp; No special efforts 
were made to seek out any missing countries or zone - those worked are a result 
of my usual operating both contesting and almost daily operating…..<b>N4NW.&nbsp; </b>
Didn't think about Marathon until I saw article in December CQ.&nbsp; Herewith casual 
operating score from about 700 *total* QSOs in 2011. Barefoot in the 'burbs, 
only got my (low) TH3 tribander back up in October, other antenna is the trusty 
Butternut vertical. &nbsp;&nbsp;Special tnx to AD1C for all his work on the utilities……<b>N5PG.&nbsp;
</b>This competition should be open to a participant in as many mode categories 
as he chooses, not limited to one choice.&nbsp; The fact is that they are separate 
competitions and should be treated as such. There is no relation between a CW 
entry or a RTTY entry or a SSB entry.&nbsp; The Mixed category is just that, a 
mixture of all the modes…..<b>N6AR.&nbsp; </b>Wow! With 10 and 12 meters alive again 
the whole game has changed. Why not develop a Marathon category for band 
countries and zones?.....<b>N8BR.&nbsp; </b>Once again, I did not set out to compete 
so missed some 2010 carry over entities by not working them again in 2011. 
Still, my activity level was high all year and we managed to work lots of DX.&nbsp; 
Sure could have used that FT/X station that showed for a few minutes on 20 
meters for an all time new confirmation……<b>N8RR.&nbsp; </b>Lots of Fun!!!!!!.......<b>NU8Z.&nbsp;
</b>So TNX for long contest hi hi. Condx during all year were better and better 
but now they have gone down again. I hope to be on next year…..<b>OK1BA.&nbsp; </b>
Will be back in 2012…..<b>ON4ON.&nbsp; </b>My first participation in the Marathon. 
Very difficult to use low power and simple antennas. Modern technologies, such 
as the skimmer and the cluster, making the possibility of low power even more 
difficult…….<b>UT9FJ.&nbsp; </b>Less than a week's worth of operating and the CQWW CW 
contest. Not too shabby considering we had no 160M antenna and the 80M antenna 
had problems. The amp failed early in the contest so most of this is actually 
low power……<b>V31AO.&nbsp; </b>Only played a little while I was getting station set 
up again after 4 years.&nbsp; Had fun!&nbsp; Should do a lot better next year!....<b>VA7ZT.&nbsp;
</b>Definitely brought the fun back to Dxing. Then, I get to do it all over 
again next year. Great idea!!.....<b>VE3KKB.&nbsp; </b>All digital.&nbsp; Thank you for 
running this operating challenge…..<b>VE4KZ.&nbsp; </b>Hoping 2012 is better, but 
improved on 2010. Only 100W and 3 element beam……<b>VK2MWG.&nbsp; </b>A great year for 
DX, and the DX Marathon added an extra bit of incentive to work it. Thanks for 
sponsoring this award……<b>VK3HJ.&nbsp; </b>Having moved into a rented (No Antennas) 
house for a while but not wanting to stop my hobby, I used a very comprised 
antenna consisting of a 20’ ground mounted wire vertical mounted against the 
house with radials just lying on the lawn fed with ladder line to an ATU&nbsp; and 
low power. Surprised and happy with what ended up in the log for this year.&nbsp; 
Would like to thank the sun for the spots, the inventers of all the digital 
modes, which really add to what a little guy can work. And a big thank you to 
the CQ DX Marathon for providing a reason to turn on the rig……..<b>VK4BL.&nbsp; </b>
This was my first entry in the DX Marathon. It was hard work at times but I had 
a couple of friends helping with advice and encouragement so all went OK……..<b>VK4CC.&nbsp;
</b>First time in the Marathon, most entertaining.&nbsp; Set a target of 250 points 
and comfortably exceeded it despite not attacking it full on…..<b>VP8NO.&nbsp; </b>
Glad to break last year's score without much regular activity - says a lot for 
the improved conditions - maybe more next year…….<b>VU2PTT.&nbsp; </b>Always fun.&nbsp; 
Considering I didn't pay attention until December, my total is only four shy of 
last year--when I really worked at it!......<b>W1EBI.&nbsp; </b>Good idea. It kept me 
going during the year and I will be trying again in 2012……<b>W2LK.&nbsp; </b>It was 
great to have 10 and 12 meters as open as they were.&nbsp; Improved conditions 
resulted in my best score since the Marathon started. My thanks to the 
organizers…..<b>W4CU.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Only operated 10 months this year and then only 
decided to chase the Marathon after the ST0R expedition in July.&nbsp; Even the 
countries worked before July were worked again in the last 5 months of the 
year……<b>W4DXX.&nbsp; </b>This was my first year to try this activity.&nbsp; It was really 
fun, like starting all over in working for DXCC with lots of entities and zones 
to chase….<b>W4NZC.&nbsp; </b>Another great year of fun and a real stimulus to get on 
the air.&nbsp; My first submission was 2009, and I have increased my score each year 
thereafter.&nbsp; Hopefully these are all good and no deductions…..<b>W4QN.&nbsp; </b>
Getting the data into this form was a lot harder than working the entities -- 
and a whole lot LESS fun!&nbsp; Software engineers and other 'retentives' must be the 
only ones happy about this.&nbsp; I lost a couple entities to pirates -- I hope I 
never meet one of them……<b>W4VIC.&nbsp; </b>Returned to amateur radio in November 
after a 30 year absence. Hopefully my results for next year will be better……<b>W7JSD.&nbsp;
</b>Score is for 30 meters monoband. Another year of fun! And going monoband 
lowered the pressure. &nbsp;Thanks for running a great DX Operating program…..<b>W9KNI.&nbsp;
</b>I had a great time focusing on 15m this year and was able to meet my goal of 
DXCC on a new band…..<b>W9KVR.&nbsp; </b>Had a great time. Not a winning score (or 
even in the ballpark), but for a little pistol I did enjoy the challenge. 
Thanks……<b>W9MJ.&nbsp; </b>Really enjoyed working on this during the past year missed 
a few as I was out of state for a couple weeks at a time. CQ contests and awards 
are always great fun to work&nbsp; towards. Hope to do better in 2012…..<b>WA4JQS.&nbsp;
</b>Enjoyed the chase this year.&nbsp; Nice way to stay active.&nbsp; See you in 2012…..<b>WA5VGI.&nbsp;
</b>Wow…didn't realize I worked DXCC plus almost all 40 zones until I checked 
the log…not bad for 100W and a dipole!.........<b>WB4OMM.&nbsp; </b>There were 
several DXpeditions and a new entity that made things interesting. Considering 
the time I could spend on the radio, this was my best effort. I hope to get over 
250 countries in 2012…..<b>WB4YDL.&nbsp; </b>It's always a challenge to work 40 CQ 
zones. I'm close but still have some to go. My overall DXCC list is growing, 
worked 176, confirmed 144. Amazing on how long it takes to work them and even 
more to get a confirmation from them. This is more like a Life Long DX MARATHON. 
Thanks for all the contacts and BEST 73, cu on the bands……<b>WB9TFH.&nbsp; </b>
Incredible propagation on the last 2 months! Ten meters was a blast and even 
worked 10 new countries and a new Zone (24). &nbsp;Hope to make 200 entities for next 
year!.....<b>WP3GW.&nbsp; </b>Nice year DX-wise. Good propagation helps a lot even if 
not a lot of spare time for radio. Great fun anyway!....<b>XV4Y.&nbsp; </b>Glad to 
enter again this year.&nbsp; It was a bit hard because my work left me little spare 
time to increase my DX score.&nbsp; A bit lower than last year.&nbsp; I hope 2012 will be 
better……<b>YV6BXN.&nbsp; </b>Glad to have made an entry at all this time: have been 
ultra-busy at work, hence not nearly as QRV as I would like.&nbsp; Excellent 
high-band condx made all the difference……<b>ZL2IFB.&nbsp; </b>The Marathon keeps me 
DX-ing year round a great contest….<b>N1AM. </b></span></p>
