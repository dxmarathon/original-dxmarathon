<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">Started 
off great for the first couple months and then things slowed down.&nbsp; Missed a 
couple Pacific operations when &quot;Irma&quot; came by.&nbsp; Will give it a go again in 
2018…...<b>W4JS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><span style="background: white">Great contest…..<b>K1SND&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b></span>2017 was a better year than 2016.&nbsp; In September I ventured into FT8 
where I worked 128 countries, all on 5 watts. &nbsp;Although the higher bands are not 
as strong as they used to be, there are still plenty of short openings on some 
very long paths……<b>K4AR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Thank you for your Marathon efforts. I enjoy 
doing it every year……<b>NU8Z&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>I tried FT8 wherever possible to show how 
big a game-changer it is for VK hams that struggle with DX……<b>VK3GA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>I 
reactivated my station after a several year hiatus. Winter storm took down my 
antennas and tower 5 years ago. Just put up the 43' vertical.&nbsp; Looking forward 
to 2018……<b>K2JL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Thanks for sponsoring the competition which really 
generated some keen interest from our Willamette Valley DX Club members during 
2016……<b>K7VIT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>I will change my antennas to have better results, even 
with the minimum Solar Cycle……<b>PP1CZ&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Enjoyed the Marathon, looking 
forward to 2018…..<b>K5TF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></span>
<span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Even 
if conditions are going down, always a nice incentive to work DX…..<b>VE2BR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b></span>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">2017 was 
both fun and frustrating, as some &quot;easy ones&quot; hid from me all year.&nbsp; KL7KK and I 
had a good run this year.&nbsp; He stepped up his&nbsp;game and dominated the second half 
of the year.&nbsp; I found it tough&nbsp;to compete with a guy who is retired and can be 
on during the&nbsp;day while I'm at work…..<b>AL7KC</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks For DX Marathon 
2017…..<b>YB4NY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>It was a good year for 40 meters entry. I worked a lot 
of nice DX. This is my best single band score so far. I missed some countries 
that were active……<b>9A2EU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>So many DXCC entities have been missed due to 
a lot of company affairs and travel…...<b>A65CA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>I missed several 
garden-variety ones.&nbsp; A tough year, and next year promises to be tougher still. 
This is a really a great program for keeping operating interest up……<b>AC7P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b>This is the first time I am entering this Marathon…….<b>ZS6AI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Bring 
the bands back……<b>N4ANV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Just 7 months of operation this year due to 
construction and to assemble a new tower and antennas.&nbsp; Nevertheless it was fun 
as always……<b>CT1IUA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>First time participating the CQ Marathon, just 
started end of August.&nbsp; It was great fun to chase any needed DX.&nbsp; Will see you 
again in 2018…..<b>DL6DH&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>DXing is tough from Antarctica, but I always 
try to work as many entities as possible on a simple wire antenna……<b>DP1POL&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</b>My 
first year in the Marathon. I felt encouraged by my friend Oscar Luis EA1DR and 
his presentation at our national convention. Will see you next year…….<b>EC1CT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b>First Entry having missed the deadline last year…..<b>G4PDF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>I tried 
to participate in the single band 6M category, I enjoyed it……<b>I4EAT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>A 
great competition……<b>W9ILY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>I participate in the Marathon digital mode 
since 2009 and every year is always more beautiful.&nbsp; I have already started the 
2018 competition…..<b>IK5FKF&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Propagation for six meters was worse than 
last year but I had more points thanks to the new digital modes……<b>IW2CAM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b>First time entrant…..<b>IZ8JAI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>I missed a lot of entities due to low 
SSN…….<b>JA0DAI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Band conditions are no good.&nbsp; Hope I can more DX in 
2018…….<b>JO7KMB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Just found the DX Marathon thanks to a post on DXLab 
group.&nbsp; Sounds like fun and gives a modest station like mine something to work 
towards. Hoping for better result in 2018……<b>K1FR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Thank you CQ 
Magazine, and John K9EL for hosting and managing the 2017 CQ DX Marathon.&nbsp; This 
was a better year overall than 2016…….<b>K4AR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>First year participating 
in the Marathon.&nbsp; All QSOs made on my 160 Meter inverted vee dipole…..<b>K8AC&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b>Conditions during most of the year were very challenging - missed a lot of 
relatively easy stuff due to poor propagation. SE Asia and the Middle East were 
particularly difficult this year - still a fun contest……<b>KB0EO&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>First 
time entering… I am 15 years old…….<b>KM4SII&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>First time contestant.&nbsp; 
Need to work harder next year…..<b>N5KAE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>FT8 really changed the digital 
QSO numbers……<b>N5ZY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>All QSOs made with JT65, JT9 and FT8 modes only………<b>NN6NN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b>Conditions made it a bit tougher this year. But fun as always……<b>NU8Z&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b>Thank you for the DX Marathon and your good work for us DX´ers…..<b>TF3DC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b>Please accept my entry for Digital Modes only…….<b>VK3LDB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Another 
enjoyable year of chasing DX in the waning sunspot cycle…...<b>VK4CC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>A 
great experience…….<b>W9C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Another Great Year. Had a lot of fun in spite 
of poor conditions…….<b>W9KNI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>I lost 3 months after lightning damage in 
my shack. Conditions seem to be worse and noise higher as last year…….<b>IN3FHE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b>I know SWLs do not participate in the Marathon, but it is a very good 
contest.&nbsp; 2017 was my best year.....<b>HA0001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Thanks for a great year 
long contest - keeps the DX fires lit . Bands were not great but did get a few 
good ones this year……..<b>WA4JQS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>2017 was a great year.&nbsp; Overall 
conditions weren’t the best, but quite good for this spot in the solar cycle……<b>WE6Z&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</b>Hopefully conditions will be better in 2018……<b>YD0RXA&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Hope to see 
you again in DX Marathon in 2018 with more Countries and Zones……<b>YG5YUD&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>
It was a very big effort for me to chase DX and contact them with only a 
multiband vertical antenna but I really enjoyed it very much. It was a very 
agreeable challenge for me……<b>YV5EN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>A tough year for me, with less time 
for radio, worse conditions and more time spent idly filling digital slots on 
FT8 instead of chasing new ones.&nbsp; Don't know how I missed Zone 2….<b>ZL2IFB</b></span></p>
