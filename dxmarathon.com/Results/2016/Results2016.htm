		The lack of sunspots did very little to dampen the enthusiasm of our DX 
		Marathon participants in 2016.&nbsp; Although the number of submitted logs 
		was down from last year, the majority of participants simply moved from 
		the higher bands to the lower bands and turned in some very impressive 
		scores.&nbsp; The maximum possible score in 2016 was 332 – only 8 points less 
		the 2015 record maximum.&nbsp;&nbsp; Competition was intense in all categories 
		except 12 meter single band. Single band participation percentage 
		actually increased over 2015, with 40, 80 and 160 more than picking up 
		the loss of 10 and 12 meter participants. &nbsp;However, in spite of fewer 
		logs and far fewer sunspots, no less than 26 all-time records were 
		broken, 48 if we include the new award categories added in 2015.&nbsp; Most 
		amazing were the new high records for CW only and Digital only.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
		lack of sunspots was clearly not a problem for these winners!</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .5in; line-height: normal">
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">With 
		the change in propagation, SSB contacts dropped by 25%.&nbsp; CW contacts now 
		make up almost half of all the 110,000 QSOs submitted in the 2016 
		Marathon. Digital QSO’s were up by 25%, although still fewer than CW or 
		SSB. &nbsp;&nbsp;Last year 10 and 12 meters accounted for almost 30% of all QSO’s, 
		yet only 10% in 2016.&nbsp; 15, 17 and 20 remained the most popular bands 
		while 30 through 160 now accounting for 30% of all QSO’s.&nbsp; Although the 
		total number of submitted logs were down, more countries and zones 
		participated&nbsp;in 2016 than in previous years.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal">
		<b><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">And 
		the Winners Are….</span></b></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: normal">
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">The 
		battle for the top spot in the DX Marathon was no less intense in 2016.&nbsp; 
		Bill, K2TQC, has been a top contender for many years, finishing 2<sup>nd</sup>, 
		3<sup>rd</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> in recent years and holds the current 
		all-time record high score for Zone 5.&nbsp; 2016 was his year!&nbsp; Bill 
		finished with a final score of 326, just one point ahead of EA1DR, PY5EG 
		and I4EAT who all finished with a score of 325 points.&nbsp;&nbsp; When multiple 
		entrants have the same score, the standings are determined by the 
		earliest date of the last QSO in the log.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oscar, EA1DR, has never 
		finished lower than 8<sup>th</sup> in the last 6 years and has also been 
		heavily promoting the DX Marathon in Spain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oms, PY5EG, was last 
		year’s winner and is always a top competitor in the Marathon.&nbsp;&nbsp; I4EAT is 
		a new DX Marathon participant and his first-time score is very 
		impressive.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: normal">
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">Another 
		first-time entrant and the 2016 Limited Class winner was Alex, VE3NEA.&nbsp; 
		Alex is best known as the author of popular ham radio software such as 
		the CW and RTTY skimmer tools, DX Atlas, Gritty and more.&nbsp; I am sure he 
		used his own tools to capture the number one spot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alex’s score of 291 
		was 5 points ahead of LU1FAM who came in second with a score of 286. &nbsp;In 
		Formula Class, 100 watt option, the 2016 winner is Walter, PY4ZO, with a 
		score of 286.&nbsp; Walter has participated in the Marathon for several years 
		and won Plaques in 2013 and 2014 for top score in South America.&nbsp; Scott, 
		N4RI, also a DX Marathon veteran, repeated his second place finish with 
		a score of 264.&nbsp; Dan, WG5G, has once again finished in the top position 
		in the QRP category.&nbsp; This is Dan’s fifth consecutive win!&nbsp; Reflecting 
		the decrease in conditions, Dan’s 2016 score was 20 points less than 
		last year at 263, but all scores in the 5 watt category were less.&nbsp; 
		Coming in second at 240 points was another long-time DX Marathon 
		participant, Fulvio, IV3AOL.&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal">
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned earlier, the amount of CW activity has 
		increased significantly in the DX Marathon and the battle for the top CW 
		score was very intense.&nbsp; We had a 50% increase over 2015 in CW only 
		submissions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lada, OK2PAY, once again took top honors, repeating his 
		2015 win.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Lada set a new all-time CW record with his 
		score of 321.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right behind Lada was Bob, W9KNI at 320.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob holds 
		many DX Marathon records and tied the previous CW high score of 320.&nbsp; 
		Bob is the Plaque recipient for the Top North America CW score. &nbsp;&nbsp;W1NG 
		was not far behind with his 3<sup>rd</sup> place score of 316.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gert, 
		PA2LO easily won the Phone title with a score of 296. Gert was also the 
		Phone winner in 2014. Second place went to PY5DK with a score of 263.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Tony, IK0OZD has won many plaques in prior DX Marathons and in 2016 he 
		turned attention to the Digital Only category. &nbsp;Not only did he win the 
		Digital only category with his score of 306, he beat the previous high 
		Digital score held by N5ZM by 24 points!&nbsp; Piero, IK5FKF, also a previous 
		Digital plaque winner, was second at 260 points.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: normal">
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">Plaques 
		are also awarded to the top score on each of the 10 through 80 meter 
		bands plus the top score on each Continent.&nbsp; In the single band 
		competitions starting with 10 meters, all 17 entries were from Brazil 
		with ZY2B at the top with a score of ZY2B.&nbsp; WK3N once again took top 
		honors on 12 meters with a score of 186.&nbsp; On 15 meters, CO6HLP came out 
		on top with a score of 189 and is our first plaque winner from Cuba. 
		LY5M was on top on 17 meters at 280 and VE3VEE once again was the king 
		of 20 meters with an impressive score of 322. &nbsp;I4TJE was the top scorer 
		on 30 with a score of 276.&nbsp; On 40 meters KB0EO scored 244 to take first 
		place.&nbsp; LY7M took top honors on 80 with a very impressive score of 248.&nbsp; 
		Congratulation to all the Band plaque winners.&nbsp; The 160 meter scores 
		were excellent as well with NO3M beating last year’s winner, N4IS, by 
		one point with his score of 186.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: normal">
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">Many of 
		the Continental battles were also very close with A65CA repeating his 
		top Asia position with a score of 319, just one point ahead of second 
		place finisher, JA2NDQ.&nbsp; The Europe Plaque goes to Oscar, EA1DR with his 
		325 score, with only 4 points separating the top five positions.&nbsp; EA8AXT 
		moved up to the number one Africa position with his score of 304, 
		breaking the old Africa record by 15 points!&nbsp; In Oceania, ZL2IFB wins 
		with a score of 316 – his 3<sup>rd</sup> top title in a row!&nbsp;&nbsp; Oms, 
		PY5EG, one of the top overall winners in the Marathon over the past few 
		years, took home top South America honors with a score of 325.&nbsp; No North 
		America plaque is awarded as Bill, K2TQC already took overall honors as 
		with the highest worldwide score.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: normal">
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">Well 
		over 100 DX Marathon certificates are awarded each year in various 
		categories, including the top Continental score for each of the three 
		modes, top score in each country, top score in each CQ zone, top score 
		in each Canadian call district plus the top score in each USA call area 
		for each of the four DX Marathon classes.&nbsp; Many new records were set 
		this year, including 18 new country records, four new zone records, nine 
		new continental records, four new Canadian call district records and 
		nine new USA call district records.&nbsp;&nbsp; Check out the record high scores 
		page on the DX Marathon website.&nbsp; For 2017, pick a category, work hard 
		and you may be able to get in the record book as well.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: normal">
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">Once 
		again Brazil took the top 3 spots in the Club competition, but for the 
		first time in many years, the Araucaria DX Group fell to third place, 
		with the CDR Group taking the top position with a score of 9615.&nbsp; The 
		top USA Club was the Northern Illinois DX Association, sponsor of the 
		top three DX Marathon plaques. Don’t forget to include your club name on 
		your 2017 DX Marathon submission.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: normal">
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">Each 
		year the DX Marathon website publishes a large amount of information to 
		help participants minimize errors in their submissions.&nbsp; The Helpful 
		Hints page can be accessed from the DX Marathon home page.&nbsp; In 2016, we 
		published almost 2,500 callsign exceptions and notes to help every 
		participant reduce the number of errors in their submissions.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also 
		recommend that you regularly update your logging program callsign 
		database. Unusual callsign prefixes seem to multiply every year, so 
		updating your program’s database is critical to properly determine the 
		DX location and/or Zone. </span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: normal">
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">
		Fortunately, many participants are updating their databases regularly as 
		a record number of submissions were error-free in 2016.&nbsp; 24% of all 
		submissions had no errors – a big improvement over last year’s 16% 
		error-free rate.&nbsp; Total error rate was 1.9%, also a tremendous 
		improvement over 2016.&nbsp; The database that is used for scoring the DX 
		Marathon includes start and end dates for all major expeditions, so 
		please make sure that dates and times are properly logged along with the 
		callsign, country and zone for each QSO.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: normal">
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">The two 
		highest error categories in 2016 were Busted Calls and Wrong Zone.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Unfortunately, the number of bad and incorrect DX Spots seems to be on 
		the increase.&nbsp; When logging a QSO from a DX spot, listen carefully to 
		the DX station to make sure the callsign is logged correctly.&nbsp; 25% of 
		all subtractions were due to Busted Calls. &nbsp;Wrong Zone was also 
		responsible for 25% of all score reductions.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is very important that 
		all non-USA hams understand that USA callsign numbers are no longer 
		required to match their QTH.&nbsp; A W6 could be in New York, or a KL7 could 
		be in Puerto Rico.&nbsp; With many special callsigns in Russia in 2016, there 
		was also many Zone 16,17,18 and 19 errors.&nbsp; Zone 2 continues to be a 
		problem as well.&nbsp; Very few VE2 stations are actually located in Zone 2.&nbsp; 
		The DX Marathon website does list the most active Zone 2 stations.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: normal">
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">Invalid 
		Callsigns was the next largest category.&nbsp; These may be busted calls that 
		were so bad that we could not determine the real callsign or simple 
		logging errors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again there were many mix-ups between “0” (Zero) 
		and “O” (Oh).&nbsp; The computer is not forgiving, so check your log 
		carefully!&nbsp; Wrong Country continues to be the 4<sup>th</sup> major cause 
		of score reductions, although the Wrong Country error rate did drop by 
		50% from 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; We applaud everyone who frequently updates their 
		logging program databases.&nbsp; Pirates were a much bigger problem in 2016 
		and their activity is always frustrating.&nbsp; We do publish all Pirate 
		activity that we are aware of on the DX Marathon website.&nbsp; As mentioned 
		earlier, the computer software does check start and end dates for most 
		DXpeditions and a significant number of Wrong Date/Time errors occurred 
		this year.&nbsp; Not in Log subtractions were minimal this year, thanks in 
		part to the many stations who now post their logs online.</span></p>
		<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: .25in; line-height: normal">
		<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Verdana,sans-serif">As part 
		of this issue you will find a complete listing of all scores plus a 
		listing of the Top Scores in all available categories.&nbsp;&nbsp; The DX Marathon 
		website will include additional information and details on the 2016 
		results plus photos of plaque winners as they become available.&nbsp; For any 
		questions or comments about the DX Marathon, please contact the author.&nbsp; 
		Thank you for your participation in 2016 and best of luck in 2017!</span></p>
