<font size="4" face="Arial">N9TF: It was an interesting DX year to say the 
least. No DXpeditions to look forward to, to any of those rare islands still 
needed by this op! &nbsp;This yearâ€™s Marathon was mostly a split between CW (thank 
you CQ for some great DX contests this year), and FT8, with a couple SSB and a 
few RTTY thrown in for good measure. FT8 won out with 49.7% of the total, and CW 
close behind with 47.5%. &nbsp;Working from home had its advantages this year, as 
some DX may not have been possible. &nbsp;I am happy with the results of my DX worked 
this year. I only wish I could have worked zone 23 for all 40 zones! Let's hope 
for a return to normal for 2021 so we can look forward to some DXpeditions to 
some of those most needed entities.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="line-height: 107%">
<font size="4" face="Arial">K2JL: First time entering Limited Class. I erected a 
Hexbeam in August 2020 but 2020 was a rough year personally and for DX. Hoping 
for a better 2021 and a better Limited Class effort.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="line-height: 107%">
<font size="4" face="Arial">K8YC: Some unfortunate circumstances over and above 
Covid-19 kept my Spiderbeam out of operation for most of the year.&nbsp; Since late 
September I have been awaiting the tree surgeon to come take down a 80+ foot 
tall oak tree that kept destroying my antenna by dropping some very large dead 
limbs!</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="line-height: 107%">
<font size="4" face="Arial">ZL2IFB: A tough year on and off the radio.&nbsp; So glad 
to have an absorbing hobby that keeps us in touch, despite the physical 
distance.&nbsp; Will the sun wake up in 2021?&nbsp; So far, it seems to be having a 
lie-in. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="line-height: 107%">
<font size="4" face="Arial">NL8F: 10121 QSO's this year - guess I should not CQ

<font size="4" face="Arial">TF3JB: A most interesting event. At the end of each 
calendar year, I say to myself...I could have done better...so I look forward to 
doing better in 2021. Thank you CQ Magazine for this most interesting event in 
amateur radio! </font></span></p>

<font size="4" face="Arial">IN3FHE : Antenna failed while I was in lockdown, the 
radio also failed. In June, the antenna was finally repaired, while I used the 
20m dipole, the only one I could tune.</font></span></p>

<font size="4" face="Arial">K7BV:&nbsp; Sad score this yearâ€¦.sigh.&nbsp;&nbsp; Heart trouble

Marathon possible it presents a challenge all year long.&nbsp; </font></span></p>

<font size="4" face="Arial">N7RD: Considering 2020 was such a lost year, CQ 
Marathon is always such fun for me.&nbsp; Gives us DXers something to get motivated 
about.&nbsp; Thanks for the great event each year.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="line-height: 107%">
<font size="4" face="Arial">IK5FKF: DXpeditions and sunspots were missing this

many spots filled by digital modes this year. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="line-height: 107%">
<font size="4" face="Arial">W4QN: Low score this year, combination of FT8 
replacing CW and poor propagation - but still a fun activity. </font></span></p>

<font size="4" face="Arial">KM8L:&nbsp; My first time entering the Marathon.&nbsp; 
Tremendous fun!</font></span></p>

<font size="4" face="Arial">OE1SGU: Thanks for another opportunity to 
participate! Well 2020 was really different: Less DXCC on the band but lots of 
more QSOs logged because of the time in lockdowns. Hope for more rare entities 
to come up in the next years. </font></span></p>

<font size="4" face="Arial">YV4ABR: This is my first time entering this contest. 
I use HRD Logger and it does not show CQ zone, so it was kind of a challenge to 
declare the zones correctly. It was a hard year but thanks god we have Ham 
Radio.</font></span></p>
