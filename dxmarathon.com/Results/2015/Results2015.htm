	<span style="font-family: Calibri">The higher HF bands are not dead!&nbsp; We all 
	expected reduced propagation in 2015, but DX Marathon participants went 
	against the odds and came up as winners.&nbsp; Compared to 2014, participation 
	increased 25%, total QSO’s were up over 8% and more countries were 
	available.&nbsp; We were not surprised that 2015 was a record breaking year, with 
	many all-time high score records broken.&nbsp; The 10, 12 and 15 Meter bands 
	accounted for over 50% of all QSO’s – very similar to 2014.&nbsp; 10 meter only 
	submissions were double those of 2014. Overall, there was a 50% increase in 
	participants chasing single band or single mode awards.&nbsp; Much of the 
	increase in participation came from the many new DX Marathon participants 
	from Brazil and Turkey. In addition, participation in Limited Class, 
	introduced last year, was up substantially with over 25% of logs claiming 
	Limited Class.&nbsp; If you run 100 watts and a small Yagi or equivalent, check 
	out Limited Class.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in">
	<span style="font-family: Calibri">As a result of the good conditions and 
	increased participation, many new all-time high scores were set: Unlimited 
	Class, Limited Class, Phone, three continental records, nine zone records, 
	15 country records plus the Club score record.&nbsp; Many of these records were 
	significantly broken and will be hard to surpass in the future.&nbsp; One of the 
	reasons so many records were broken was the availability of workable 
	entities.&nbsp; Over 300 entities plus 40 zones were available in 2015 – the 
	highest number ever since the Marathon has been run.&nbsp;&nbsp; We thank the many 
	expeditions to rare locations.&nbsp; CW continues to be the most popular mode 
	used in the Marathon, but the percentage of CW QSO’s was slightly lower in 
	2015, due mainly to a significant increase in Digital QSO’s.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>
	<span style="font-family: Calibri"><font size="4">And the Winners Are….</font></span></b></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
	<span style="font-family: Calibri">Since 2008, Oms, PY5EG, has been a major 
	participant and supporter of the Marathon, including Plaque sponsorship 
	through the Araucaria DX Group.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oms holds six all-time record high DX 
	Marathon scores (<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="../../Records/AllTimeRecords2015.htm">..\..\Records\AllTimeRecords2015.htm</a>) 
	including the joint Unlimited Class overall record high score of 330 with 
	OM3EY – until 2015.&nbsp; Oms has set the bar very high with an incredible score 
	of 336!&nbsp; Oms only missed four entities that were active in 2015 – we can 
	only imagine the hours he spent working DX.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oms also submitted a perfect 
	log with no errors.&nbsp; Following Oms in Unlimited Class was Tony, IK0OZD, the 
	2014 DX Marathon Unlimited Class winner at 333 points, a new European 
	record.&nbsp; In third place was Serge, R6YY, at 329 points - a new Russian and 
	new Zone 16 record.&nbsp; There was a 3-way tie between OM3EY, K2TQC and N0UN for 
	fourth place at 328 points, with the final order determined by the earliest 
	date of the last entity QSO. </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
	<span style="font-family: Calibri">A new record high score was also set in 
	Limited Class by John, OM5XX, with a score of 319 – very impressive for only 
	100 watts.&nbsp; N0AH and SP3NYC were second and third, respectively, with scores 
	of 296 and 290.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Formula Class, Joe, W4TV, has taken top honors with a 
	score of 293.&nbsp; Joe uses a dipole and inverted Vee antennas from his Florida 
	QTH.&nbsp; Joe has come in second the previous three years, so it is great to see 
	Joe’s call at the top of Formula Class.&nbsp;&nbsp; Completing the top three positions 
	were N4RI and W2NK in second and third place, respectively.&nbsp; In the 5-watt 
	Formula Class, Dan, WG5G retains his first place title with a score of 
	283.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dan was first in the QRP class in 2012, 2013 and 2014 and second in 
	2011.&nbsp;&nbsp; Congratulations on this great accomplishment. Rounding out the top 
	three were OK2FD at 274 points and longtime DX Marathon participant W8QZA at 
	255 points.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
	<span style="font-family: Calibri">In 2015, we added awards for top mode 
	scores for each continent in addition to the worldwide top mode awards. 
	Initially the Continental mode winners received certificates, but we have 
	now changed the CW winners in Europe and North America to Plaques (see 
	sidebar).&nbsp; We welcome and thank our new sponsors!&nbsp; With a 50% increase in 
	single mode submissions, there was a significant increase in competition for 
	those awards.&nbsp; Lada, OK2PAY came out on top of the CW pileup with a score of 
	312 to take the CW Plaque.&nbsp; Erik, K9EU, was second with a score of 298 and 
	winner of the new North American CW Plaque. In 3<sup>rd</sup> place was 
	Norm, W4QN, with a score of 297.&nbsp; Wayne, N0UN, really topped everyone with 
	his incredible score of 328 on Phone.&nbsp; He broke the previous record by 5 
	points which he held.&nbsp; Gert, PA2LO, last year’s Phone winner, was second 
	this year with a score of 305.&nbsp; Ed, EA8AXT, was third with a score of 287.&nbsp; 
	For the Digital mode, Piero, IK5FKF, claims top honors with a score of 258.&nbsp; 
	This is Piero’s third first place Digital finish – congratulations!&nbsp; AA8R at 
	249 points and IK0PEA at 242 points rounded out the top three Digital 
	scores.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
	<span style="font-family: Calibri">Plaques are also awarded to the top score 
	on each of the 10 through 80 meter bands plus the top score on each 
	Continent.&nbsp; In the single band competitions, there was very tight 
	competition on 20 meters between DX Marathon veteran Bob, W9KNI and DX 
	Marathon newcomer Marvin, VE3VEE.&nbsp; In the end Marvin took top honors just 
	one point ahead of Bob.&nbsp; Of interest, Marvin’s station is 100% remote.&nbsp; No 
	new Band records were set in 2015, but with top scores of 262, 284 and 300 
	(10,12,15 meters respectively), the higher bands clearly produced a lot of 
	DX.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the Continental battles were also very close with A65CA on top 
	in Asia with a score 322, just one point ahead of last year’s winner 
	JE1FQV.&nbsp; Dunia, EA8MT once again took top Africa honors, but EA8AXT was only 
	2 points behind.&nbsp;&nbsp; The battle in North America was particularly close with 
	both K2TQC and N0UN finishing with scores of 328.&nbsp; In the case of ties, we 
	use the earliest date of the last Entity worked to determine placement.
	</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
	<span style="font-family: Calibri">Certificates will once again will be 
	given to the top scorer in each country and zone, plus the top scorers on 
	the 6 and 160 meter bands.&nbsp; Late last year we added certificates for high 
	scores in each USA call district for each of the four main classes plus the 
	high score in each VE call area.&nbsp; Also new this year are certificates for 
	the high single mode score in each Continent for each of the three modes.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	In all, there are many certificates now available.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
	<span style="font-family: Calibri">Club competition was very exciting in 
	2015, with the Araucaria DX Group in Brazil setting a new Club record with 
	an amassed score of 10,359.&nbsp; The top three Club positions were all held by 
	PY clubs.&nbsp; The Carolina DX Association and the Northern Illinois DX 
	Association placed 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> respectively.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t 
	forget to include your club name on your 2016 DX Marathon submission.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
	<span style="font-family: Calibri">Each year the DX Marathon website 
	publishes a large amount of information to help participants minimize errors 
	in their submissions.&nbsp; The Helpful Hints page can be accessed from the DX 
	Marathon home page.&nbsp; In 2015, we published 3,881 callsign exceptions and 
	notes to help every participant reduce the number of errors in their 
	submissions.&nbsp; Unfortunately, many people are not utilizing this valuable 
	resource.&nbsp;&nbsp; Callsign prefixes seem to multiply every year and very few 
	logging programs will properly determine the DX location and/or Zone from 
	the just the callsign.&nbsp;&nbsp; We encourage everyone to utilize the information we 
	collect from many sources.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
	<span style="font-family: Calibri">Perhaps due to the many first time 
	participants, the overall error rate in the 2015 Marathon was 2.5% - an 
	increase over last year’s 2% rate.&nbsp; It is always difficult to reduce 
	someone’s score due to simple errors, but proper logging is critical for a 
	successful DX Marathon submission.&nbsp; Scoring is computerized, so please watch 
	“0” (zero) vs “O” (Oh), “1” (one) vs “I” (Letter I), and other 
	similarities.&nbsp; Only 16% of entrants submitted error free logs.&nbsp; </span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
	<span style="font-family: Calibri">The highest error category in 2015 was 
	“Wrong Country”.&nbsp; In other words, the callsign of the DX station was logged 
	correctly, but that callsign was submitted for the wrong country.&nbsp; Since the 
	majority of participants use computer logging, the logging software is 
	likely assigning the wrong country to the callsign.&nbsp; Assigning the wrong 
	country to a callsign accounted for 28% of all errors – a large number. If 
	your logging program has a callsign database, be sure to update it on a 
	regular basis.&nbsp; Many prefixes (such as FO, E5, VK9 and others) do not 
	indicate a country, so each callsign must be investigated.&nbsp; “Wrong Zone” 
	accounted for 23% of all errors.&nbsp; Similar to Wrong Country, the DX callsign 
	was logged correctly, but the wrong zone was assigned to the prefix.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
	largest source of Zone errors, 30%, comes from USA callsigns.&nbsp;&nbsp; Current FCC 
	rules do not require hams to change prefixes when moving.&nbsp; It is not unusual 
	to have a KL7 living in Florida or a W2 living in California.&nbsp; Please check 
	each USA callsign carefully for the proper zone.&nbsp; Together, “Wrong Country” 
	and “Wrong Zone” account for over 50% of all errors – errors that could 
	easily be avoided with up to date country databases.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
	<span style="font-family: Calibri">Busted calls were the second highest 
	error category accounting for 24% of all subtractions.&nbsp; The majority of the 
	busted callsigns is due to bad spots on the DX spotting networks.&nbsp; Most 
	errors are not intentional, but the amount of DX spots with callsign errors 
	is increasing every year.&nbsp; Listen carefully to each DX station to make sure 
	it is really who think it is.&nbsp; Although my personal score does not count in 
	the Marathon, I participate each year to feel the pulse of the contest.&nbsp; I 
	was very surprised when the computer subtracted two points off my score. 
	&nbsp;Upon investigation, I had clicked on a DX spot to populate my logging 
	program, without listening to the callsign being sent. Sure enough, the spot 
	was wrong.&nbsp; The other major error category was “Invalid Callsign” which can 
	occur for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; Fortunately, Pirate activity was lower in 
	2015 and only accounted for 31 lost points.</span></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.25in">
	<span style="font-family: Calibri">As part of this issue you will find a 
	complete listing of all scores plus a listing of the Top Scores in all 
	available categories.&nbsp;&nbsp; The DX Marathon website will include additional 
	information and details on the 2015 results plus photos of plaque winners as 
	they become available.&nbsp; For any questions or comments about the DX Marathon, 
	please contact the author.&nbsp; Thank you for your participation in 2015 and 
	best of luck in 2016!</span></div>
