&nbsp;I am here for the seventh time.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"> 
I really enjoy the DX Marathon and I hope to again be first in the Digital 
category…...<b>IK5FKF</b>.&nbsp; T</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">his 
is a great contest!&nbsp; I decided to focus on 10 meters this year, as the band will 
be ratcheting down with the solar cycle decline. The conditions on 10 m this 
year were substantially worse than last year. I missed a lot of stuff either due 
to my schedule, the propagation, or the time a needed entity was on the air - 
band not open yet to my area. Regardless of the outcome, I had a lot of fun 
chasing down the DX again this year…...<b>KB0EO</b>.&nbsp; </span>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">I hope to win on 30M 
after 5 years without win the first place……<b>FG4NO</b>.&nbsp; The bands just were 
not very good for us here on the East side of NC. &nbsp;But it was fun, and will do 
it another year. &nbsp;Would like to have a report on the results……<b>N4ANV</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Thanks guys for running this each year, what a fun contest……<b>VK4FFAB</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Marathon is always fun. Good incentive to work DX even when your DXCC total 
is 331. Already worked 113 DX and 26 zones since New Year's Day……<b>VE2BR</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;

year for me due to a few medical problems and long trips, but I enjoy the 
contest every year…...<b>W4CU</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></tt>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
Was a good year, with many days of poor conditions - will see what 2016 brings 
us…..</span><strong><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:

I live in a subdivision with all kinds of restrictions but I have a big attic 
and things have worked out for me getting on the air. I had a tower and 
tribander 50 years ago when I was in high school so I've kinda gone backwards……<b>WA9LEY</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I found the help pages excellent for keeping me better organized this year…..<b>N0AH.</b>&nbsp; 
I get to work DX and not have to screw around with QSL cards…..<b>W9XS</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
line-height:107%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">I wasn’t serious 
about the Marathon this year—too much going on—but added some new ones in 
December, including two new ones on the 31<sup>st</sup>!&nbsp; Maybe if I succeed at 
retirement….. <b>W1EBI</b>.&nbsp; </span>
<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
I achieved my goal of improving over last year.&nbsp;This is the best contest and 
hope it's a record year of entries…..<b>W0RIC</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>

Conditions are on the decline but had great fun again this year…….<b>VK4CC</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">
I know it won't be the winning score but I tried my best to defend last years 
score.&nbsp; Congrats to all winners…..<b>PA2LO</b>.&nbsp; A</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">ntenna 
problems first 3 months of the year meant I missed a few and missed several easy

My first year to enter……<b>W7SLS</b>.&nbsp; A fantastic years' DXing for me, 
culminating on a real high thanks to P5/3Z9DX…..<b>ZL2IFB</b>.&nbsp; All QSO'S made 
during &quot;SOTA&quot; (Summits On The Air) operations on mountain tops……<b>HB9CBR/P</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Always fun doing the Marathon. Not as good as the last two years but still fun. 
Hope for a better 2016…..<b>WA4JQS</b>.&nbsp; Another good year on HF.&nbsp; Higher band 
conditions not as good as in previous years so looking forward to the next solar 
cycle……<b>GI4SJQ</b>.&nbsp; Another great year of DX chasing fun….<b>W9KNI</b>.&nbsp; 
Bands not as good as years past but still had lots of fun, looking forward to 
next year……<b>WG5G</b>.&nbsp; Conditions not great, appreciate any activity….<b>W8DX</b>.&nbsp; 
During 2015 I was operating QRP, mostly CW but also a few SSB QSO’s…..<b>SM5MEK</b>.&nbsp; 
The DX Marathon keeps me dx'ing all year - great contest……<b>N1AM</b>.&nbsp; 
Everybody - thanks for QSOs……<b>LY5M</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; First Marathon. Worked over 3,500 
stations in 2015……<b>KX7YT</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; First time in the Marathon - lots of fun……<b>AJ8B</b>.&nbsp; 
First timing posting results for CQ DX Marathon….<b>K7VIT</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; First year back 
in DXing for some time and had a great time…..<b>G0MFR</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am happy to have 
participated in the Marathon for the 1st time and the result despite my location 
not being favorable, as in downtown…..<b>CT4VB</b>.</span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
&nbsp;I am very pleased with my results this year. 77 countries worked off a single 
wire antenna using low power is quite the achievement…..<b>VK4FFAB</b>.&nbsp; I enjoy 
this contest every year, seems to keep my DX mind clear and wanting more each 
year.&nbsp; It's a wonderful program and I encourage more to get involved.&nbsp; Thank you 
for all the effort you place in this event each year…..<b>N7RD</b>.&nbsp; I love this 
contest! It keeps me interested in DX all year long….<b>.W8QZA</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I only 
found out about the CQ DX Marathon in March. What a wonderful thing. It brought 
new life to ham radio for me……<b>VE3VEE</b>.&nbsp; I will be glad to participate in 
this award program in future, but I will not bother with it if the PDF 
electronic award is the prize for winning the country…..<b>S51DX</b>.&nbsp; It is 
interesting to note that all 40 zones were worked over a 24 hour and 30 minute 
period on just 20 Meter CW during the CQWW CW contest……<b>W1NG</b>.&nbsp; It was a 
wonderful year with a good number of ATNO's. I hope to increase my CQ DX 
Marathon Score for the next year…… <b>VU3DMP</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of fun.&nbsp; Great way to 
encourage operation.&nbsp; It was a pretty good year…..<b>AC7P</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meager effort, 
partly due to being busier at work this year. 500W to a 2-element Yagi on a 
nearby hilltop, operated remotely from my home office……<b>N6ML</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Missed a 
few this year, many interruptions with travel and equipment maintenance.&nbsp; Tower 
and antennas down for several weeks reduced opportunity to work a few more…..<b>W4QN</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
More difficult this year with numerous solar flares and low solar flux.&nbsp; But the 
DX was there…..<b>WA5VGI</b>.&nbsp; My first entry……<b>VA7CRZ</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My fourth year, 
and most frustrating, pile-up behavior was terrible.&nbsp; Giving the Marathon a 
rest…..<b>N4KW</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; My score is down from last year, blame it mostly on 
propagation as I had hard time working into South Asia…..<b>W2NK</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rookie – 
First year on HF – great fun…..<b>KA9BBQ</b>.&nbsp; Second Year submittal….<b>WC3W</b>.&nbsp; 
Second-time entry. Didn't purposefully run in the Marathon, but did manage some 
countries while contesting, chasing ATNO and band slots/modes……<b>N0FCD</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Seemed like band conditions were significantly worse than 2014, but I somehow 
still bested my 2014 score by 10 points!&nbsp; The Marathon is great fun…..<b>KM7N</b>.&nbsp; 
Thank you the CQ Marathon.&nbsp; CU in 2016…..<b>HB9TRR</b>.&nbsp; Thank you very much to 
all. Good DX. Best 73's…..<b>PY5DK</b>.&nbsp; The DX Marathon has been pushing up my 
daily activities throughout the year….<b>JA0DAI</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The limited power 
edition should be 200 watts or barefoot rig output…..<b>VE1NB</b>.&nbsp; This was a 
good year despite absolutely terrible conditions….<b>VE1JS</b>.&nbsp; This was the 
first full year at our new QTH in Arizona. Seems to be a much better ham 
location then the old QTH in Colorado. Having these awesome JK Antennas have 
really paid off. Thanks for a fun year of DX! Best hobby in the world….<b>W0RIC</b>.&nbsp; 
Thanks for excellent event…..<b>NP4RA</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Very nice competition! I've got a 
better final score than last year, 225 country verified.&nbsp; I hope to do a better 
result next year….<b>.IK2ULV</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wonderful time and lots of fun. But bad luck 
with antenna problems and lightning strike at the end of September. I was able 
to fix the antennas only late in December. I hope for better conditions next 
year…...<b>N4IS</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
