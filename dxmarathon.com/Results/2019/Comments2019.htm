<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">R9AB:&nbsp; 73 to all DX-hunters! </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">ON6NL:&nbsp; A good way to start the new year is
closing the old one. I did not specially work for the Marathon in 2019 and I see
I missed a lot of “easy” ones. For 2020 I will really do an effort, so watch for
me!&nbsp; </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">AK1P:&nbsp;&nbsp; Another fun year!&nbsp; 73</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">PA3FQA: CW only this year. All this FT8 makes no
fun.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">NU8Z:&nbsp; Despite what seemed like worse
conditions, I managed to improve on last year’s score. Great yearly event!
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">VK3MB : Thanks for running this program. </span>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">YV5AJI: Fantastic opportunity</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">F6GCP: First attempt in the Marathon</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">N9TF: FT digital mode was the mode of the game
this year, especially for us little pistols! Of my 201 Qs, 165 were FT digital,
5 were RTTY, and 31 were CW. Not a bad tally for being at the bottom of the
solar cycle! Missed Zones 22 and 26. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">9A2EU: Great year for DXing. 259 DXCC in one
year. Using TS-590S great Rig for DX. CU in 2020 DX marathon!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">TA4RC: I am happy more this year than last
year.&nbsp; I have worked hard and have been more successful.&nbsp; Thanks all.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">VE9VIC I: &nbsp;had a lot of fun, not much time in
the summer, I hope to get better antennas next year, 73 to all</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">VE3VEE: I worked more DXCC entities this year
than in previous years. Should I say Long Live The Solar Minimum? LOL :-)</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">DP1POL: It's just a small log this year as I
only operated from Antarctica for about two weeks. I hope to be back in 2020!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">W9VA: Licensed 1952 - First digital QSO 67 years
later - 9 Aug 2019.&nbsp; Old Dog - New Tricks.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">W9ILY: Lots of fun but missed some easy ones!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">W4QN: Low score this year, combination of FT8
replacing CW and poor propagation- but still a fun activity. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">JA0DAI: Now, FT8 is coming up to my major mode.
It works well on low bands, and I enjoyed it.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">K6KSO: Rookie year.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">ZS2EZ: Rotator Failed middle of November.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">IK5FKF: Since 2009 I participate in this
fascinating race, always arriving in the first 5 (four times first place). This
year due to low solar activity, even the big stations have used FT8 to connect
to the DX-peditions. This has reduced the possibility of excelling.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">KD4LEM: Thanks for another great year....
Looking forward to 2020</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">AC7P: Thanks for helping keep interest in DX
going during this period of solar minimum.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">VK4CC: Thanks for running the Marathon again.
Always lots of fun.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">OE1SGU: Thanks to the organizers and everyone
for the activity! See you in 2020!</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">KZ3I: The tree supporting my antenna fell and I
was forced to get by with a 20 meter Zepp at 30'&nbsp; for the 2nd half of the year.
Also lost 3 months operating to home renovation. I am looking forward to 2020.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">W4HY: Third year of participation.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">JA1IRH: This event is one of my major target of
amateur radio activity in every year. Thank you very much.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">WO7R: This is my first digital mode only entry.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">YD1RKT: This is my first DX Marathon, and so
glad I could participate.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">CX3AL: This was my second participation. Worked
very hard digital modes (FT8 and FT4) during 2019, almost daily, trying to
achieve new CX and continental record, at present held by PY2RJ with 256 score
in 2017. Made a total of 6858 QSO's.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">K4ZO:&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the first year I have been able
to enter.&nbsp; Retirement is great.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">W2NK: This will probably be my last year of
competing. Digital is beyond my abilities or even stronger, my interest. I'm a
ham radio operator, not a computer geek that seems to be the top criterion
today. Digi should have its own category. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">K1PTF: This year is my 3rd time entering the DX
Marathon. When I look back over this year long log, I am amazed at all the
places in this world that I contacted. I especially enjoyed sharing the
experience with my friends in Salt City DX Association. </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">TA1NAC: Thanks for all the participation</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">K9CJ: Worst local noise I've had in over 20
years. Started about mid-September and averages about s6/s7 now. Other than
that, the Marathon is fun.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">I4EAT:&nbsp; Worst propagation this year prevented to
increase score, anyway glad to work again old friends and some new one: CY9, S7
and KL7, last two via moon.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">VK2HV: With all the FT8 Q’s being sent from
others I can’t compete as of late.&nbsp; I have just been doing band/mode slots. This
is just an incentive to get back on the radio after 5 years. Let’s hope
conditions pick up as I normally only operate on 10 17 and 30m</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">WB4RA:&nbsp; My first time with the Marathon.&nbsp; I
noticed that there was no credit for number of DX contacts. That might be a nice
add since many of the countries are worked more than once.</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">PP1CZ: Last year I made a few contacts, due to
the problems in my antennas.&nbsp; In 2020 I hope to have a better result, with new
antennas (DB 18 E and 80 Meter dipole).</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">
<span style="line-height: 107%">DL6DH: It was great fun again, unfortunately,
stiff conditions and out of a valley it is often not possible to work a dx
station due to lack of a flat elevation angle...</span></font></p>
