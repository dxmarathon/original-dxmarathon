After a disappointing 6M season, I decided to try Marathon. With attic dipoles 
it proved challenging, frustrating and exhilarating……..<b>K9HWL</b>.&nbsp; 2nd year 
in Marathon…….<b>W2WGK</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; After taking several months off from the radio 
towards the beginning of the year, I only had a couple dozen countries worked on 
10M before the middle of September when the band got hot….. <b>N0AH</b>.&nbsp; Always 
great fun chasing DX for the Marathon…….<b>WA4JQS</b>.&nbsp; Always interesting to 
see the results. Thanks!.....<b>W9ILY</b>.&nbsp; Another good year for sunspots and 
propagation, especially the crazy period around CQ WW.&nbsp; Missed a few countries 
this year, some while my tribander was on the ground being repaired, others due 
to not having quite enough ERP to break the pileups……<b>ZL2IFB</b>.&nbsp; Another 
year of excitement and friendly competition. Great event, thanks for running 
it……<b>.VK4CC</b>.&nbsp; Best year yet!......<b>K6YK</b>.&nbsp; Enjoy this every 
year!.....<b>NK0S</b>.&nbsp; Enjoyed it all year! Looking forward to 2014……<b>W3ZJ</b>.&nbsp; 
Fabulous to have this new reporting program worked out.&nbsp; Thanks, all…….<b>W4VIC</b>.&nbsp; 
First participation in Marathon after many years of radio. I enjoyed it……<b>IK2QPR</b>.&nbsp; 
First time and enjoy this event……<b>YC1CWK</b>.&nbsp; First time entry…..<b>KI0J</b>.&nbsp; 
First time entry……<b>KS0T</b>.&nbsp; First year submittal…….<b>WC3W</b>.&nbsp; Great 
idea!......<b>VY2MP</b>.&nbsp; Had a decent go at the Marathon this year.&nbsp; Well 
pleased with my score. Most enjoyable contest yet again……<b>VK3HJ</b>.&nbsp; I could 
have done better if I hadn't the antenna down for 3 months.&nbsp; I hope a better 
score in 2014……<b>IK2DJV.&nbsp; </b>It was a very big effort for me to chase DX and 
contact them with only a multiband vertical antenna and less than 100 watts 
output&nbsp; but I really enjoyed it very much……..<b>YV5EN</b>.&nbsp; Included EZ8BP just 
in case.&nbsp;&nbsp; I actually exchanged emails with him!.......<b>K2TQC</b>.&nbsp; It is 
always fun to be in this marathon contest each year…….<b>JA0DAI</b>.&nbsp; It’s my 
second time to participate in CQ DX Marathon. It was real fun but I was not 
concentrating on regular DXCC countries and missed some easy ones………<b>UA3AGW</b>.&nbsp; 
Just need more spare time to get a better score. &nbsp;Great fun see you again next 
year……<b>YV6BXN</b>.&nbsp; Missed many entities due in part by minor health issues 
but I had another fun year of DXing……..<b>N4KW</b>.&nbsp; Missed many Pacific 
activations and a few easy ones. Very happy with claimed score of 276…….<b>E73Y</b>.&nbsp; 
Missed quite a few that were QRV on CW, and frustrated by the many on SSB but 
not CW.&nbsp; But pleased with CW only score……<b>W4QN</b>.&nbsp; My best year ever.&nbsp; Most 
number of Q's and DXCC's.&nbsp; Band has been in great shape all year and had great 
fun on the HF bands.&nbsp; Roll on…….&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>GI4SJQ</b>.&nbsp; My first ever DX Marathon 
entry, what a blast!.....<b>.NV5E</b>.&nbsp; My first Marathon Entry…….<b>KG5VK</b>.&nbsp; 
My friend told me about this annual event. CQ DX Marathon makes Dxing activity 
still alive……<b>YC0QR</b>.&nbsp; My year on QRP! Max power output was 5 watts on 
Digital and CW…….<b>VU2LBW</b>.&nbsp; New All-Time Mixed Best……<b>W6XK</b>.&nbsp; Not very 
active this year although putting up a 2ele Steppir in October caused lots of 
activity chasing 12m &amp; 17m…….<b>N5PG</b>.&nbsp; Thanks for running the exercise. I 
missed at least a dozen this year. Now we can start all over again…….<b>AI2C</b>.&nbsp; 
Thanks for the acceptance of my log……<b>YB1LZ</b>.&nbsp; Thanks once again.&nbsp; It's 
hard to believe that this is my 8th entry.&nbsp; The Marathon still feels new…….<b>W4CU</b>.&nbsp; 
This contest is really fun, not a big gun operator but sure had fun trying to 
work new countries each and every day…….<b>N7RD</b>.&nbsp; This is my first entry for 
CQ DX Marathon…….<b>YB2LSR</b>.&nbsp; This was my best year yet for the DX Marathon 
since its inception working all 40 zones (all CW) and 235 (229 on CW) countries. 
I missed many good ones that would have really helped……<b>.K8CQ</b>.&nbsp; This year 
really started in the fall here on the West Coast…..<b>W8DX</b>.&nbsp; Thanks all for 
the QSOs during 2013. Save ham radio, save the environment - use digital QSL…….<b>PY2RN</b>.&nbsp; 
First timer.&nbsp; This sure made the year more interesting……<b>AA8R</b>.&nbsp; It was a 
busy year for me, and I was not able to get much &quot;air time&quot; due to other 
commitments.&nbsp;I hope that 2014 is better for me……..<b>KF6ILA</b>.&nbsp; Thanks very 
much!&nbsp; I really enjoy the Marathon.&nbsp; I'm even less of a sprinter these days as 
the years rack up!.......<b>ZL2iFB</b>.&nbsp; <span style="color:black">It was an 
enjoyable year chasing DX.&nbsp; Wish a lot of the stations would operate SSB instead 
of all CW…….<b>N4ANV</b>.&nbsp; </span>Many thanks for the opportunity to 
participate……<b>VK8HPB</b>.&nbsp; This time I tried CW only, but the result is not 
too good as many were missed.&nbsp; I will try CW only once more and hope for better 
result…..<b>UA9FAR</b>.&nbsp; Best results&nbsp;for me&nbsp;since contest inception.&nbsp; Not bad 
considering my severe antenna restrictions.&nbsp;Don't ever let someone with CC&amp;R 
restrictions say they can't work DX……..<b>K8CQ</b>.&nbsp; I've just finished putting 
a lot of hours into the checking. Hoping for an error free log. It was great fun 
this year once again. I would have to say there were more serious competitors 
than ever before - that's great!......<b>W9KNI</b>.&nbsp; <span style="color:black">
In typical fashion I found several of the more common entities missing when it 
came time to tally up.&nbsp; I have to pay more attention to my need list…….<b>W4VQ</b>.&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang="ES" style="font-family: Arial">Nice Event.......<b>CE4KCA</b>.&nbsp;
</span><span style="font-family:Arial">Many thanks for running the exercise. Now 
we can start all over……<b>AI2C</b>.&nbsp; Unfortunately 2013 was an off radio 
year……..<b>PY2ADR</b>.&nbsp; Worked WAZ in only 6+ days …my previous record was doing 
it in 8 weeks!.........<b>N8DE</b>.&nbsp; </span></p>
