			Thanks again for running this contest…….<b>W8QZA</b>.&nbsp; &nbsp;M</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">y 
			first entry for the DXMarathon…….<b>PA2LO</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for all the 
			fun during 2014, 160m propagation just inexistent during this second 
			solar cycle peak…….<b>N4IS</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I Hope a lot of folks participate 
			this year. It’s a fun contest…….<b>W0RIC</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a slightly 
			busier year in Cambodia for 2014. Hopefully in 2015 I'll get a 
			better antenna up…….</span><b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">XU7AEU</span></b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">.&nbsp;&nbsp;

			<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">
			Not a big score as I took 8 weeks off&nbsp;touring around Australia.&nbsp; 
			Thanks for the contest, see if I can do better this year……<b>VK8HPB</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
			</span>
			<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">I had 
			a great time as always trying to top my previous best and did so, by 
			clearing 181 DX entities!&nbsp; It was also nice to add a few new ones to 
			the overall list as I get closer to the 300 total mark……<b>W9KVR</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			T</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">his 
			is my first attempt in the Marathon or any other contest in 55 years 
			of ham radio.&nbsp; The pace fits my operating style much better than 
			traditional lightning fast exchanges of weekend concentrated 
			contests……..<b>W3NA</b>.&nbsp; Thanks for giving me a reason to work DX 
			all year.&nbsp; Please consider awards for modes CW, phone, digital, low 
			power etc. for separate zones and/or countries……<b>VK3MEG</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Thanks for running this neat competition……<b>N0KE</b>.&nbsp; </span>
			<span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">
			Thanks for the contest……<b>WU9B</b>.&nbsp; Thank you for adding the 
			Limited class option…….<b>ZS1D</b>.&nbsp; Lots of fun. Hope to do again 
			in 2015……<b>NU8Z</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Always fun to do this through the year….<b>AA8R</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			A big thank you to all the DX-peditioners and hams on remote places 
			in the world who made DX hunting possible.&nbsp; 2014 was a great ham 
			radio year…..<b>PA2LO</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All good fun again this year…….<b>VK4CC</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Another fun year - already starting for 2015…….<b>W9KNI</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Another fun year for the DX Marathon.&nbsp; I kept the stress level low 
			by not worrying about what countries I had worked.&nbsp; With that 
			philosophy, I only missed 8P and EK of the easy ones I normally QSO……<b>K8CQ</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			So far five years that I have participated. Every year gets more and 
			more beautiful……<b>IK5FKF</b>.&nbsp; As always, a very interesting test 
			of one's DX-ing capabilities (and perseverance) - best of all it 
			allows one to compete against oneself year on year, this on an 
			absolutely even playing field. A whole lot of fun…...<b>VK3FM</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Been working most of the year during much of the best times for 
			operating on HF so missed a fair bit of DX…….<b>CT7ACG</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Better 
			than 2013, but always 39 zones, this time zone 2, what a pity…….<b>IN3FHE</b>.&nbsp; 
			Big Fun to start over each year. Recharges the excitement battery 
			and provides a chance to see old friends for a quick greeting.&nbsp; 
			Thank you for this great annual activity……<b>K7BV</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could not 
			dedicate as much time this year due to other commitments, but 
			nevertheless a very enjoyable year……..<b>N4KW</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Enjoyed Formula 
			Class using 5 watts this year……<b>N1AM</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though I missed 
			out on a few and perhaps could have made it to 200, I can't 
			complain, as I still compiled the most DX stations in a year than I 
			had ever before……<b>W9KVR</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; First time entry so hopefully I did 
			OK…….<b>M0RNR</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; First time ever entry to the DX Marathon. 
			Licensed in April 2011. Operating when time permits; mostly digital 
			5W and CW 5-100W on 40m using ground mounted 31' vertical wire 
			antenna……<b>VA3PAW</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; First time to submit my log for the DX 
			Marathon. CW Only……<b>DU1XX</b>.&nbsp; First-time entry. Thanks……<b>N0FCD</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Fun contest, lots of competition……<b>N0UN</b>.&nbsp; Good fun.&nbsp; Much 
			easier to score when you have a separate log for the year in 
			question.&nbsp; I don't know what we'll do if AD1C ever stops his good 
			work on conversion programs.&nbsp; Good work Jim…….<b>VE1JS</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Great 
			fun during the year……<b>WA4JQS</b>.&nbsp; Great fun each year…..<b>W9ILY</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Great fun…..<b>K3RA</b>.&nbsp; Great fun.&nbsp; Thanks for organizing this 
			operating activity…….<b>AC7P</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Second year entering the 
			Marathon.&nbsp; It has been great fun but pretty tough being in VK3 with 
			only 100w so you have to be smart and well prepared…….<b>VK3MEG.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			How nice - new for 2014 - 1A0C popped up and workable about three 
			minutes before I was going to send in my log.&nbsp; Great program - can't 
			wait until you add band-countries to the competition……<b>VE1RGB</b>.&nbsp; 
			It has been very challenging for me to hit the 100 mark using my 
			Hustler mobile vertical on the back of a Jeep in an RV park.&nbsp; I 
			really enjoyed it… will do better this next year……<b>K8OSF</b>.&nbsp; 
			It's been a fun year. Many thanks to all those who were at the other 
			end of the QSOs……<b>GI4DOH</b>.&nbsp; Just a casual effort at DX-ing, but 
			very interesting to see the analysis of my log…...<b>AJ6T</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Just learned about the Marathon.&nbsp; What a great way to summarize a 
			year's activity…….<b>KB1VUN</b>.&nbsp; More fun than ever! Indoor 
			antennas really can work……<b>K9HWL</b>.&nbsp; Most of QSOs were made from 
			portable locations…….<b>LZ2HT</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got back on the air on August 
			21 after a several year hiatus from the HF bands…….<b>AD2EE</b>.&nbsp; My 
			second year in the Marathon……<b>KG5VK</b>.&nbsp; Not a very good year - 
			well below my peak score of last year.&nbsp; Still enjoy participating 
			and tracking progress……..<b>KF0IQ</b>.&nbsp; Not as good as last year’s 
			CW only, but then the effort was not as much as last year.&nbsp; I am a 
			DX-er, and chasing DX is the game.&nbsp; CQ Marathon is a terrific 
			incentive to get on the air and continue in a hobby I have enjoyed 
			for over 60 years…….<b>W4QN</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not much of a score this year, 
			but I love this contest - it does exactly what it is intended to do… 
			motivates me to get on the radio with a fresh start every January.&nbsp; 
			Thanks and keep it up…….<b>W2RDS</b>.&nbsp; Once again a very fun 
			contest, even for us little DX guys.&nbsp; Thank you for supporting it 
			and look forward to next year……<b>N7RD</b>.&nbsp; Proud to submit to CQ 
			Marathon from Zone 40 for the first time. Decision not made until at 
			year end - so missing a few easy ones. Thanks to Jim, AD1C for 
			making log conversion to score sheet easy…….<b>TF3DC</b>.&nbsp; Really 
			enjoyed running this contest.&nbsp; Worked a lot of stuff I hadn't seen 
			in years……<b>K4IE</b>.&nbsp; Really great fun to look for any single 
			entity on 40m.&nbsp; It has been amazing to feel the sensation of working 
			a new one even if it's an easy one. Thanks a lot for the Marathon…….<b>IK0YVV</b>.&nbsp; 
			Second Year submittal……..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>WC3W</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank You for nice 
			contest……<b>LY5M</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you!&nbsp; Long time CQ subscriber, first 
			year participant……..<b>N4GBK</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the nice 
			organization……<b>TC3P</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The DX Marathon always makes my 
			activity high. Thanks…..<b>JA0DAI</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This activation only using 
			Balcony antenna. Great performance for me to continue next year……<b>TA5FA</b>.&nbsp; 
			It's fun to look back at a year's worth of chasing DX…….<b>K3JT</b>.&nbsp; 
			First CQ DX Marathon and not the last…….<b>CT7AIX</b>.&nbsp; Trying a 
			single band submission for 10M before this solar cycle takes my 
			favorite band away….I really enjoy the Marathon…….<b>KM7N</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
			Work and family demanded a lot of attention this year.&nbsp; Virtually 
			all of my QSOs came in the last few months of the year.&nbsp; It was fun 
			trying to rack up a respectable score in a much shortened operating 
			window……..<b>KK9T</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Will try a more serious entry in 2015. 
			Never really checked my scores and missed some really easy ones.&nbsp; 
			Nevertheless I'm quite surprised that I worked 211 countries in 
			2014…...<b>EI7JZ</b>.&nbsp; It wasn't until after the two CQWW contests, 
			when I sorted my main log into just 2014 contacts that I considered 
			entering the DX Marathon competition.&nbsp; It has been a lot of fun 
			chasing and working some of the most exotic DX from a very modest 
			station…..</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">.</span><b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">N9TF</span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">.&nbsp;
