CQ Policy Statement for the 2022 DX Marathon</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#0000FF">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#0000FF">On March 17<sup>th
</sup>2022, CQ Communications, Inc., announced that it will not accept 
competitive entries in any of its sponsored contests by amateur radio stations 
in Russia, Belarus or the Donbas region of Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Logs submitted by these 
stations will be accepted only as checklogs. In addition, contacts with these 
stations by other participants will have zero point value and will not count as 
multipliers.&nbsp;&nbsp; This decision applies to all CQ sponsored contests, including the 
DX Marathon.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#0000FF">As the DX 
Marathon is a year long contest activity, this note is to clarify how the CQ 
announcement affects the DX Marathon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any contacts made before March 26<sup>th</sup>, 
2022 with stations from Russia or Belarus will count for the 2022 DX Marathon.&nbsp; 
Contacts with Russia or Belarus made on or after March 26<sup>th</sup>, 2022 
will not count for the 2022 DX Marathon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a station from Russia or Belarus 
submits a log for the 2022 DX Marathon, only contacts made before March 26<sup>th</sup>, 
2022 will count for credit.</font></p>
