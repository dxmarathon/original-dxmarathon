<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. Can I enter more than one 
category?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A:&nbsp; The current rules allow 
each participant to submit one log per location.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. If I submit my total log, 
will the DX Marathon extract only the QSOs for the band and/or mode for which I 
would have the highest score?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: The participant must choose 
which category to enter upon submission.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. Can I submit multiple logs 
and have the scoring software choose the one with the best score?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A:&nbsp; The current rules allow 
each participant to submit one log per location.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. Can I submit a log for a 
single band/single mode combination?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: Yes, but the scoring 
software will consider the entry a single mode entry.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, we do not 
offer single band/single mode awards (for example all 17meter FT8)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. What if I miss the deadline 
and submit after January 5<sup>th</sup>?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: We will be happy to accept 
your log and it will be scored and the results published separately with any 
other late logs.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. The DX Marathon submission 
form seems to be locked and I cannot make any changes to the country names, 
prefixes, etc.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. In order for the scoring 
software to accurately score all submissions, every log must be in an identical 
format.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. Why does it take so long for 
the results to be published?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. High Claimed scores are 
published within a few days of the submission deadline, but the final results 
are based on CQ Magazine publication deadlines.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. Is there any cost to enter 
the DX Marathon and receive awards?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. There is no cost to the 
entrant.&nbsp;&nbsp; All certificates are downloadable PDFs and the cost for the plaques 
are covered by the plaque sponsors.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. Does the DX Marathon website 
provide updates during the year on the top scores?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. The majority of participants 
prefer to keep their current scores private, so there is no current progress 
listing on the website.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. I have a summer cottage and 
have small antennas there and low power.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I add &nbsp;those QSOs to my total 
form my home station?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A:&nbsp; The current rules allow 
each participant to submit one log per location.&nbsp; You are welcome to enter a 
second log from your second QTH.&nbsp; For example, I could enter as K9EL and K9EL/8.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. I live in a high rise 
building, with my vertical antenna on the roof.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the antenna meets the 
basic qualifications for Formula Class, it appears my height does not allow me 
to enter in Formula Class.&nbsp; With only 100 watts it is difficult to compete in 
Unlimited Class.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. The Formula Class was 
created to allow participants with minimal antenna system to enter the DX 
Marathon.&nbsp;&nbsp; With low dipoles and ground mounted verticals, there is fair 
competition.&nbsp;&nbsp; A vertical or a dipole on the roof of a high rise building has a 
significant advantage,</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. Why doesn’t the Marathon 
offer a 100 watt version of the Unlimited Class?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. The majority of participants 
with towers and yagis own amplifiers.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is simply not enough demand for a 
low power unlimited class.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. I received my summary of 
last year’s entry and I made a simple error for which I have an alternate QSO – 
why can’t I substitute that QSO and gain back that point?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. All scoring is done in 
February to allow time for writing the magazine article in time for publication 
deadlines.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time you receive your score summary, the results have long 
been determined and awards created.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not possible to change anything on 
your log after the January 5<sup>th</sup> submission deadline.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. I submitted my log on 
January 2<sup>nd</sup> and after reviewing it, I found a mistake.&nbsp; Can I 
re-submit?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. Yes.&nbsp; You can re-submit any 
time as long as the submission meets the submission deadline.&nbsp; The new log will 
simply overwrite your previous submission.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. I worked a station that is 
not listed on QRZ.COM and not listed on the DX Marathon’s Helpful Himts 
webpage.&nbsp; How do I determine if the call is real or not?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. If you are not sure, please 
send an email to the DX Marathon Manager.&nbsp; All inquiries are generally answered 
within 24 hours.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. I worked a station in a rare 
entity, but never received my 73 and there is no online log.&nbsp; Should I still 
enter the QSO even though I am not sure I am in the log?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: One of advantages of the 
Marathon is that there is no penalty for not in log or busted call subtractions, 
other than losing that point.&nbsp; If you are not sure if you worked the station, 
enter it anyway – you may be surprised.</font></p>
