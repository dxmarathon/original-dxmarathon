<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. Can I enter more than one
category?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A:&nbsp; The current rules allow
each participant to submit one log per location.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. I want to submit for a
single band but not sure which band I should choose. Will the DX Marathon extract only the QSOs for
my best band and use that band for my single band submission?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or can
I submit multiple logs - one for each band?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: If you want to enter as a
single band participant, you must decide when you submit and enter only QSO's
for that band and only one log.&nbsp; The DX Marathon will not decide for you.&nbsp;
If QSOs are entered for more than one band, your entry will become an all band
entry.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. I want to submit for a
single mode but not sure which mode I should choose. Will the DX Marathon extract only the QSOs for
my best mode and use that mode for my single mode submission?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or can
I submit three logs - one for each mode?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: If you want to enter as a
single mode participant, you must decide when you submit and enter only QSO's
for that mode and only one log.&nbsp; The DX Marathon will not decide for you.&nbsp;
If QSOs are entered for more than one mode, your entry will become an all mode
entry.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. Can I submit multiple logs
and have the scoring software choose the one with the best score?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A:&nbsp; The current rules allow
each participant to submit <u>one log per location</u>.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. The DX Marathon rules for
Formula Class antennas, option 1 is confusing.&nbsp; It states: &quot;</font><font face="Arial"><span style="line-height: 107%"><font size="4">Operators
selecting the 5-watt option are limited to antennas on a single tower and whose
height does not exceed 65 feet or 20 meters above ground elevation.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Does the word &quot;whose&quot; apply to the antennas or the tower?</font></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. Sorry for any confusion.&nbsp;
Many QRP participants do not have towers, so the word &quot;whose&quot; refers to
antennas.&nbsp; No antenna can be over 65 feet in height for the 5 watt class.&nbsp;
The Rules will be clarified further for contest year 2024.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. Can I submit a log for a
single band/single mode combination?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: Yes, but the scoring
software will consider the entry a single mode entry.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, we do not
offer single band/single mode awards (for example all 17meter FT8)</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. When are CQ Zones important
when submitting on the scoring sheet and why was I penalized one point because
of a wrong zone? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. To qualify for a zone
worked, the call entry that you place for the respective zone must be in fact
located in the claimed zone.&nbsp; If you enter a call sign for example claiming zone
3 as an entry, and that call sign is in zone 5, this is an incorrect zone and
you will lose a point.&nbsp; The bottom line, make sure that all zone&nbsp; calls are in
fact located in the zone you are claiming.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. What if I miss the deadline
and submit after January 5<sup>th</sup>?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: We will be happy to accept
your log and it will be scored and the results published separately with any
other late logs.&nbsp;&nbsp; We reserve the right to treat a late log as a &quot;checklog&quot;
or ignore it entirely.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. The DX Marathon submission
form seems to be locked and I cannot make any changes to the country names,
prefixes, etc.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. In order for the scoring
software to accurately score all submissions, every log must be in an identical
format.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. Why does it take so long for
the results to be published?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. High Claimed scores are
published within a few days of the submission deadline, but the final results
are based on CQ Magazine publication deadlines.&nbsp; </font>
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Between the time
high claimed scores are published and the CQ Magazine deadline, the DX Marathon
team will be carefully checking logs for accuracy.&nbsp; Official results and
rankings will be made available after June 1.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. Is there any cost to enter
the DX Marathon and receive awards?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. There is no cost to the
entrant.&nbsp;&nbsp; All certificates are downloadable PDFs and the cost for the plaques
are covered by the plaque sponsors.&nbsp; </font>
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">The DX Marathon
staff does incur costs and we welcome any donations via PayPal.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. Does the DX Marathon website
provide updates during the year on the top scores?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. The majority of participants
prefer to keep their current scores private, so there is no current progress
listing on the website.&nbsp; </font>
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Participants can
load their scoresheet during the year multiple times.&nbsp; The last submitted
scoresheet will supercede previously submitted scoresheets.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. I have a summer cottage and
have small antennas there and low power.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can I add &nbsp;those QSOs to my total
form my home station?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A:&nbsp; The current rules allow
each participant to submit <u>one log per location</u>.&nbsp; You are welcome to enter a
second log from your second QTH.&nbsp; For example, I could enter as WC3W and
WC3W/0.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. I live in a high rise
building, with my vertical antenna on the roof.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the antenna meets the
basic qualifications for Formula Class, it appears my height does not allow me
to enter in Formula Class.&nbsp; With only 100 watts it is difficult to compete in
Unlimited Class.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. The Formula Class was
created to allow participants with minimal antenna system to enter the DX
Marathon.&nbsp;&nbsp; With low dipoles and ground mounted verticals, there is fair
competition.&nbsp;&nbsp; A vertical or a dipole on the roof of a high rise building has a
significant advantage and is disallowed.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. Why doesn’t the Marathon
offer a 100 watt version of the Unlimited Class?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. The majority of participants
with towers and yagis own amplifiers.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is simply not enough demand for a
low power unlimited class at this time.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. I received my summary of
last year’s entry and I made a simple error for which I have an alternate QSO –
why can’t I substitute that QSO and gain back that point?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. All scoring is done in
February to allow time for writing the magazine article in time for publication
deadlines.&nbsp;&nbsp; By the time you receive your score summary, the results have long
been determined and awards created.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not possible to change anything on
your log after the January 5<sup>th</sup> submission deadline.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. I submitted my log on
January 2<sup>nd</sup> and after reviewing it, I found a mistake.&nbsp; Can I
re-submit?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. Yes.&nbsp; You can re-submit any
time as long as the submission meets the final submission deadline of January
5th.&nbsp; The new log will
simply overwrite your previous submission.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. I worked a station that is
not listed on QRZ.COM and not listed on the DX Marathon’s Helpful Hints
webpage.&nbsp; How do I determine if the call is real or not?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. If you are not sure, please
send an email to the DX Marathon Communication Manager, K2CIB@dxmarathon.com.&nbsp; All inquiries are generally answered
within 24 hours.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. I worked a station in a rare
entity, but never received my 73 and there is no online log.&nbsp; Should I still
enter the QSO even though I am not sure I am in the log?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A: Remember the &quot;solid contact
rule.&quot;&nbsp; If, on your side of the QSO, you copied the DX' call and copied the DX
sending back your call, you can certainly submit the QSO.&nbsp; It meets our
requirements.&nbsp; That said, it is better, if you can, to submit QSOs you are more
certain of.&nbsp; See &quot;best practices.&quot; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. My logging as most assign a
CQ Zone to a Q submitted on my score sheet.&nbsp; Why did I get flagged for having
the wrong CQ Zone?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;A. Each logging program uses
different sources of identifying a CQ zone with a call.&nbsp; If for example, QRZ is
used by the logging program, each station call sign operator must manually input
their CQ Zone and ITU Zone into QRZ.&nbsp; If the operator makes a mistake in
entering the CQ Zone, you have made a mistake.&nbsp; All entries when using a logging
program that gets the CQ Zone data from QRZ, for example like DXKeeper in the
default position, should be double checked by you before submission.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have
found that the country data base maintained by AD1C is highly accurate.&nbsp; This
data base is used by N1MM, WSJT-X, DX4WIN and others.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">Q. How will the new
organization work, and if I have any questions, where should my questions be
directed?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">A. The administrative work will
be split among five functional areas.&nbsp; Depending on your question, you should
direct it to the appropriate person with a cc: to WC3W Program Administrator.&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Q. What are best
practices for submitting QSOs?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">A. Some QSOs are
easier to approve than others.&nbsp; Some are more error prone than others. If you
have a choice about what to submit, we recommend you follow the best practices
listing below in the order that they are listed:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">1) QSOs you have
confirmed by tools such as LOTW, Clublog, eQSL, QRZ’s logbook.&nbsp; We don’t require<i>
</i>confirmations, but confirmed QSOs are much more likely to be real ones.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">2) For zones,
prefer Canadians over Americans for zones 3, 4, and 5.&nbsp; Prefer VO2 for zone 2.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">3) For zones,
prefer “regular” Russian calls like UA0CA over calls like R1155RW.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">4) QSOs whose
callsigns are known to LOTW, Clublog or QRZ.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">5) QSOs from
callsigns we have approved before.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">6) Double-check
stations with these prefixes:&nbsp; 3D2, E5, FO, FK, VK9.&nbsp; Their prefix does not
always tell which DXCC entity to which they belong.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">7) Most QRZ
entries have CQ Zone data in them.&nbsp; But because the user enters that
information, zone entries may be incorrect.&nbsp; Most entities (countries) have one
and only one zone.&nbsp; Use that.&nbsp; Those that don’t are mostly determined by the
call sign (US calls, R0xxx Russian calls, and VK9 calls are the principal
exceptions).&nbsp; Find out what your logger does.&nbsp; It probably implements a lot of
this.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">Avoid submitting
these if you can:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">1) Busted calls,
pirates, or invalid operations we call out in Helpful Hints.&nbsp; These, we have
already promised to reject.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">2) Calls from
very rare locations (the kind that are only activated once a decade).&nbsp; The
WP5HAM you think you worked was probably WP4HAM or a pirate.&nbsp; Double check.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif">3) Rovers, SOTA,
POTA stations.&nbsp; By definition these folks move around.&nbsp; We may come to a
different answer than you do about where they were.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">
<font size="4">4) Calls with “funny” or “nonstandard” suffixes.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:
IS0SZU/FB.&nbsp; Is it France or Sardinia?&nbsp; If it’s all you have, turn it in, but in
our scoring check, our answer may be determined to be different from yours.&nbsp; We
have many multiple sources to check such unusual calls at our disposal.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif">
<font size="4">5) &quot;Stateside&quot; US 1x1 calls.&nbsp; If you worked K8H (American Samoa)
in 2022, submit it without fear.&nbsp; We will learn about 1x1s to US Possessions.&nbsp;
If you worked K7M, think twice.&nbsp; Not only was it activated in just about every
&quot;7 land&quot; state in 2022, it was also activated in North Dakota, which is zone 4,
not zone 3 as most 7 land calls are.&nbsp; Accurate information on US 1x1 stations is
hard to come by.&nbsp; We do have sources,&nbsp;good ones, but definitive?&nbsp; Not really. &nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</font></p>
